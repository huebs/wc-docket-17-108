    Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order, and Order - WC Docket No. 17-108
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">
    <br/>
</p>
<p class="s1" style="padding-left: 15pt;text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">
    Background<span class="s3">: Over twenty years ago, President Clinton and a Republican Congress established the
            policy of the United States “to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for
            the Internet . . . unfettered by Federal or State regulation.” For decades, Commission policies encouraged
            broadband deployment and the development of the Internet. That ended two years ago. In 2015, the Commission
            imposed heavy-handed, utility-style regulation on Internet service providers (ISPs). Since then, broadband
            investment has fallen for two years in a row—the first time that that’s happened outside a recession in the
            Internet era. And new services have been delayed or scuttled by a regulatory environment that stifles
            innovation.</span>
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">
    <br/>
</p>
<p class="s3" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0;text-align: left;">
    This <em>Declaratory Ruling</em>, <em>Report and Order</em>, and <em>Order </em>would return to the bipartisan
    consensus on light- touch regulation, ending utility-style regulation of the Internet. This will promote future
    innovation and investment. And more investment in digital infrastructure will create jobs, increase competition,
    and lead to better, faster, cheaper Internet access for all Americans, especially those in rural and low-income
    areas.

<ul id="l1">
    <li style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">
        <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">
            Restore the classification of broadband Internet access service as an “information service”—the
            classification affirmed by the Supreme Court in the <em>Brand X </em>case.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li style="padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">
        <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">
            Reinstate the private mobile service classification of mobile broadband Internet access service.

    </li>
    <li style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">
        <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">
            Clarify the effects of the return to an information service classification on other regulatory
            frameworks, including the need for a uniform federal regulatory approach to apply to interstate
            information services like broadband Internet access service.

        <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">
            Adopt transparency requirements that ISPs disclose information about their practices to consumers,
            entrepreneurs, and the Commission.

    </li>
    <li style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: -18pt;text-align: left;">
        <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">
            Restore the Federal Trade Commission’s ability to protect consumers online from any unfair, deceptive,
            and anticompetitive practices without burdensome regulations, achieving comparable benefits at lower
            cost.

                        established the policy of the United States “to preserve the vibrant and competitive free
                        market that presently exists for the Internet . . . unfettered by Federal or State
                        regulation.”</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 4pt;">1</span>

                            years ago to heavy-handed utility-style regulation of broadband Internet access service and
                            return to the light-touch framework under which a free and open Internet underwent rapid and
                            unprecedented growth for almost two decades. We eliminate burdensome regulation that stifles
                            innovation and deters investment, and empower Americans to choose the broadband Internet

                        restore broadband Internet access service to its Title I information service classification.
                        We find that reclassification as an information service best comports with the text and
                        structure of the Act, Commission precedent, and our policy objectives. We thus return to the
                        approach to broadband Internet access service affirmed as reasonable by the U.S. Supreme

                            Commission’s definition of “interconnected service” that existed prior to 2015. We determine
                            that this light-touch information service framework will promote investment and innovation
                            better than applying costly and restrictive laws of a bygone era to broadband Internet
                            access service. Our balanced approach also restores the authority of the nation’s most
                            experienced cop on the privacy beat—the Federal Trade Commission—to police the privacy
                            practices of Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</span>

                    <a href="#bookmark78" class="s31">Next, we require ISPs to be transparent. Disclosure of network
                        management practices, performance, and commercial terms of service is important for Internet
                        freedom because it helps consumers choose what works best for them and enables entrepreneurs
                        and other small businesses to get technical information needed to innovate. Individual
                        consumers, not the government, decide what Internet access service best meets their
                        individualized needs. We return to the transparency rule the Commission adopted in
                        2010</a><span class="s9">4 </span>with certain limited modifications to promote additional
                    transparency, and we eliminate certain reporting requirements adopted in the <em>Title II

                <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">
                    Finally, we eliminate the Commission’s conduct rules. The record evidence, including our
                    cost-benefit analysis, demonstrates that the costs of these rules to innovation and investment
                    outweigh any benefits they may have. In addition, we have not identified any sources of legal
                    authority that could justify the comprehensive conduct rules governing ISPs adopted in the <em>Title
                    II Order. </em>Lastly, we find that the conduct rules are unnecessary because the
                    transparency requirement we adopt, together with antitrust and consumer protection laws, ensures
                    that consumers have means to take remedial action if an ISP engages in behavior inconsistent
                    with an open Internet.

                    For the next 16 years, the Commission repeatedly adopted a light-touch approach to the Internet
                    that favored discrete and targeted actions over pre-emptive, sweeping regulation of Internet
                    service providers. In the 1998 <em>Stevens Report</em><a href="#bookmark96" class="s31">, the
                    Commission comprehensively reviewed the Act’s definitions as they applied to the emerging

                    We reinstate the information service classification of broadband Internet access service,

                        class="s9">57</span><span class="s12"> </span>Based on the record before us, we conclude
                    that the best reading of the relevant definitional provisions of the Act supports classifying
                    broadband Internet access as an information service. Having determined that broadband Internet
                    access service, regardless of whether offered using fixed or mobile technologies, is an
                    information service under the Act, we also conclude that as an information service, mobile
                    broadband Internet access service should not be classified as a commercial mobile service or its
                    functional equivalent. We find that it is well within our legal authority to classify broadband
                    Internet access service as an information service, and reclassification also comports with
                    applicable law governing agency decisions to change course. While we find our legal analysis
                    sufficient on its own to support an information service classification of broadband Internet
                    access service, strong public policy considerations further weigh in favor of an information
                    service classification. Below, we find that economic theory, empirical data, and even anecdotal
                    evidence also counsel against imposing public-utility style regulation on ISPs. The broader
                    Internet ecosystem thrived under the light- touch regulatory treatment of Title I, with massive
                    investment and innovation by both ISPs and edge providers, leading to previously unimagined
                    technological developments and services. We conclude that a return to Title I classification
                    would facilitate critical broadband investment and innovation by removing regulatory uncertainty
                    and lowering compliance costs.

                        reasonable statutory interpretation must account for both ‘the specific context in which . .

                            all of the information processes listed in the information service definition. We also find
                            that broadband Internet access service likewise provides information processing
                            functionalities itself, such as DNS and caching, which satisfy the capabilities set forth in
                            the information service definition. We then address what “capabilities” we believe are being
                            “offered” by ISPs, and whether these are reasonably viewed as separate from or inextricably
                            intertwined with transmission, and find that broadband Internet access service offerings

                        definitions to broadband Internet access service as it is offered today most soundly leads
                        to the conclusion that it is an information service. Although the Internet marketplace has
                        continued to develop in the years since the earliest classification decisions, broadband
                        Internet access service offerings still involve a number of “capabilities” within the
                        meaning of the Section 3 definition of information services, including critical capabilities
                        that all ISP customers must use for the service to work as it does today. While many popular
                        uses of the Internet have shifted over time, the record reveals that broadband Internet
                        access service continues to offer information service capabilities that typical users both
                        expect and rely upon. Indeed, the basic nature of Internet service—“[p]rovid[ing] consumers

                        high-speed telecommunications”—has remained the same since the Supreme Court upheld the
                        Commission’s similar classification of cable modem service as an information service twelve
                        years ago.</a><a href="#bookmark151" class="s11">77</a>

                    particular functions classified under pre-1996 Act precedent not because the technologies are
                    identical in all particulars, but because they share the same relevant characteristics for
                    purposes of making a classification decision under the Act. Given the close fit between DNS and
                    the address translation function classified as an information service under the MFJ coupled with
                    the fact that the statutory information service definition (and telecommunications management
                    exception) was drawn more directly from the MFJ, we find the MFJ precedent entitled to more
                    weight than analogies to <em>Computer Inquiries </em>precedent. We thus are not persuaded by
                    arguments seeking to analogize DNS to directory assistance, which the Commission classified as
                    “adjunct-to-basic” under the <em>Computer Inquiries</em>. <em>See, e.g.</em>, OTI New America
                    Comments at 33-34 (“The parallel in telephone service is computer-assisted directory assistance,
                    where a user can find the phone number (like an IP address in BIAS) of a person based on their
                    name (like a domain name in BIAS). This service has long been adjunct-to-basic and did not
                    transform telephone service into an information service. DNS similarly does not direct a
                    classification of BIAS as an information service.”); Barbara van Schewick and Patrick Leerssen

                    Although the court was not entirely clear, it seemed to suggest that such functions were not
                    information services under the MFJ. This category appears to bear little similarity to caching,
                    however. The third category of ‘storage and retrieval’ information service functions identified
                    by the court would include the BOC’s provision of “voice messaging, voice storage and retrieval,

                    relevant to our classification of broadband Internet access service, we reject the view that
                    Congress would have expected classification under the 1996 Act’s statutory definitions to be
                    tied to the substantive common carrier transmission <em>requirements </em>imposed under those
                    frameworks. <em>See, e.g.</em>, Free Press Comments at 58-61. We conclude that the best view of
                    the text and structure of the Act undercuts arguments that Congress sought to preserve the
                    substance of pre-1996 Act regulations through the definitions it adopted. Instead, where
                    Congress sought to address substantive requirements akin to those in the MFJ and <em>Computer
                    Inquiries </em>it did so by adopting subjective obligations in the 1996 Act—even if not
                    identical to the pre- 1996 Act requirements—and subject to their own Congressionally-specified
                    standards for when and to what entities they apply. <em>See, e.g.</em>, 47 U.S.C. §§ 251, 256. In
                    addition, the wholesale service focus of substantive MFJ and <em>Computer Inquiries </em>common
                    carrier transmission obligations also distinguishes them from the retail service we classify
                    here, likewise undermining any claimed relevance of those pre-1996 Act transmission requirements
                    to our classification decision. The Commission recognized, for example, that the transmission
                    underlying broadband internet access required by the <em>Computer Inquiries </em>to be offered on
                    an unbundled, common carrier basis and provided to ISPs was not a “retail” service within the
                    meaning of section 251(c)(4) resale requirements. <em>Deployment of Wireline Services Offering
                    Advanced Telecommunications Capability</em>, CC Docket No. 98-147, Second Report and Order,
                    14 FCC Rcd 19237 (1999). Nor did such a common carrier transmission service itself enable access
                    to the Internet, even if purchased by end-users. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>id</em>. at 19240, para. 6
                    &amp; n.16 (noting a DSL transmission offering that, as explained in the associated marketing
                    materials, end-users could purchase and use in conjunction with certain partner ISPs). By
                    comparison, under the <em>Computer Inquiries</em>, the finished service offered to end-users
                    relying on the required common carrier transmission as an input was regulated as an enhanced
                    service, not a common carrier offering, even when offered by the facilities-based carrier’s
                    subsidiary. <em>See, e.g.</em>, <em>Computer II Final Decision</em>, 77 FCC 2d at 474, para. 230
                    (when carriers’ enhanced services subsidiaries offer enhanced services “the subsidiary itself is
                    not regulated”). Given our focus here on the finished retail broadband Internet access service,
                    we see little relevance to prior regulatory requirements that were imposed to ensure competing
                    providers had access to a wholesale input in the form of a compelled common carriage offering of
                    bare transmission that did not itself provide Internet access.

                            This distinction makes broadband Internet access service fundamentally different than
                            standard telephone service, which the Supreme Court noted does not become an “information
                            service” merely because its transmission service may be “trivially affected” by some

                    Knowledge Comments at 34-35; Tech Knowledge Reply at 11-17; Letter from Fred Campbell, Director,
                    Tech Knowledge, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 17-108, at 1-2 (filed Sept.
                    19, 2017). But we find no evidence in the text of the statute that Congress intended to import
                    the commercial mobile service definition from one section into another, and our precedent
                    similarly does not countenance such an importation. Nor is the end-to-end analysis the only
                    pre-1996 Act precedent from which the concept of “points” in the “telecommunications” definition
                    might have been drawn so as to unambiguously foreclose our conclusion that “via
                    telecommunications” is satisfied here. <em>See, e.g.</em>, 47 CFR § 21.2 (1995).

                    was skeptical that a telecommunications service classification of cable modem service would

                    interpretation. Section 230(f)(2) defines an interactive computer service to mean “<em>any
                    information service</em>, system, or access software provider that provides or enables
                    computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or

                    Comcast Comments at 7-8. The legislative history of section 230 also lends support to the view
                    that Congress did not intend the Commission to subject broadband Internet access service to
                    Title II regulation. The congressional record reflects that the drafters of section 230 did “not
                    wish to have a Federal Computer Commission with an army of bureaucrats regulating the Internet.”

                    Having determined that broadband Internet access service, regardless of whether offered using
                    fixed or mobile technologies, is an information service under the Act, we now address the

                    conclude that mobile broadband Internet access service should not be classified as a commercial

                        service is closely substitutable for a commercial mobile radio service; whether changes in
                        price for the service under examination, or for the comparable commercial mobile radio
                        service would prompt customers to change from one service to the other; and market research

                    <a href="#bookmark339" class="s31">In 2007, the Commission found that wireless broadband
                        Internet access service was not a commercial mobile service because it did not meet the
                        definition of an “interconnected service” under the Act and the Commission’s rules. It found
                        that wireless broadband Internet access was not “interconnected” with the “public switched
                        network” because it did not use the North American Numbering Plan, which limited
                        “subscribers’ ability to communicate to or receive communication from all users in the
                        public switched

                    <a href="#bookmark340" class="s31">The Commission concluded that section 332 and the
                        Commission’s rules “did not contemplate wireless broadband Internet access service as
                        provided today” and that a commercial mobile service “must still be interconnected with the

                    Commission reversed course. First, the Commission changed definitions of two key terms
                    within the definition of commercial mobile
                    service.</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 4pt;">266</span>
                    <a href="#bookmark342" class="s31">It broadened the definition of the term “public switched
                        network” to include services that use “public IP
                        addresses.”</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 4pt;">267</span>
                    <span class="s3">And it redefined the term “interconnected service” by deleting the word “all”
                            from the requirement that the service give subscribers the capability to communicate with
                            “</span><span class="s4">all </span><a href="#bookmark343" class="s31">other users on the
                    public switched network,” so that a service would be interconnected even if users of such a
                    service could not communicate with all other
                    users.</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 4pt;">268</span>
                    <span class="s3">By manipulating these definitions, the Commission engineered a conclusion that
                            mobile broadband Internet access was interconnected with the public switched network and was
                            an interconnected service under section 332.</span>

                <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">
                    Second, the <em>Title II Order </em><a href="#bookmark344" class="s31">found that even if it had
                    not changed the definitions, it could change the scope of the service to meet them.
                    Specifically, the Commission found that “users have the ‘capability’ . . . to communicate
                    with NANP numbers using their broadband connection through the use of VoIP
                    applications.”</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 4pt;">269 </span>Accordingly
                    it found that, by including services not offered by the mobile broadband Internet access service
                    provider as part of the service, mobile broadband Internet access service would now meet the
                    regulatory definition of “interconnected service” adopted in 1994.

                    Third, the <em>Title II Order </em><a href="#bookmark345" class="s31">eschewed the functional
                    equivalence test contained in the Commission’s rules to find that mobile broadband Internet
                    access service was functionally equivalent to commercial mobile service. Rather than apply
                    that test, the Commission reasoned that the two were functionally equivalent because “like
                    commercial mobile service, [mobile broadband Internet access service] is a widely available,
                    for profit mobile service that offers mobile subscribers the capability to send and receive
                    communications on their mobile device to and from the public.”</a><a href="#bookmark345"
                                                                                         class="s2">270</a>

                    In the <em>Internet Freedom NPRM</em>, the Commission proposed to “restore the meaning of ‘public

                            and “interconnected service” that the Commission adopted in the 1994 </span>Second CMRS

                            readopt the earlier definitions</span>. <span class="s3">We further find that, under these
                            definitions, mobile broadband Internet access service is not a commercial mobile

                    <a href="#bookmark349" class="s31">We find that the Commission’s original interpretation of
                        “public switched network” was more consistent with the ordinary meaning and commonly
                        understood definition of the term and with Commission
                        precedent.</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 4pt;">274</span>
                    <a href="#bookmark350" class="s31">On multiple prior occasions before Section 332(d)(2) was
                        enacted, the Commission used the term “public switched network” to refer to the traditional
                        public switched telephone
                        network.</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 4pt;">275</span>
                    <a href="#bookmark351" class="s31">In 1981, for example, the Commission noted that “the public
                        switched network interconnects all telephones in the
                        country.”</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 4pt;">276</span>
                    <a href="#bookmark352" class="s31">In 1992, the Commission described its cellular service policy
                        as “encourag[ing] the creation of a nationwide, seamless system, interconnected with the
                        public switched network so that cellular and landline telephone customers can communicate
                        with each other on a universal
                        basis.”</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 4pt;">277</span>
                    <a href="#bookmark353" class="s31">Courts also used the term “public switched network” when
                        referring to the traditional telephone
                        network.</a><span style=" color: black; font-family:'Times New Roman', serif; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-size: 7pt; vertical-align: 4pt;">278</span>
                    <a href="#bookmark354" class="s31">Based on this history of usage of the term, the Commission,
                        in 1994, tied its definition of the term “public switched network” to the traditional
                        switched telephone network. We find this approach appropriately reflects the fundamental
                        canon of statutory construction that “unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as
                        taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.”</a><a href="#bookmark354" class="s2">279</a>

                            and which we readopt today, and therefore it does not meet the definition of commercial

                            capability to communicate with or receive communication from all other users of the
                            public switched network, the Commission has permitted an interconnected service to
                            restrict access to the public switched network in certain limited ways (such as the
                            blocking of 900 numbers). This limited exception to general access has existed since the
                            original definition of the term “interconnected service” was adopted, and the record
                            does not demonstrate that it has caused confusion or misunderstandings about what
                            services may be considered interconnected. Accordingly, we will continue to apply the
                            definition of “interconnected service” in this fashion, and we see no need to codify
                            language reflecting the exception. We agree with Verizon, however, that “[t]here is a
                            massive difference between limited, targeted restrictions that deny access to certain
                            points on the network and the situation envisioned by the <em>Title II Order</em>, where
                            millions of users on what is ostensibly the same network are incapable of reaching each
                            other.” Verizon Comments at 49, n.184.

                            updated definitions would be consistent with Congress’s intent to create a symmetrical
                            regulatory framework among mobile services that were similarly “broadly available” to
                            the public. <em>See Title II Order</em>, 30 FCC Rcd at 5786, para. 399. While we agree
                            that Congress intended, in adopting section 332, to regulate similar mobile services
                            symmetrically, we do not believe that Congress intended for the Commission to regulate
                            mobile services symmetrically simply because they are similarly “broadly available.”
                            First, being “effectively available to a substantial portion of the public” is a
                            necessary, but not sufficient, requirement for classification as commercial mobile
                            service. Second, as noted, Congress set as the touchstone for regulatory symmetry only
                            those mobile services that are “functionally equivalent.”

                            Voice reflect the fully interconnected nature of the mobile broadband and legacy
                            telephone networks.” OTI New America Comments at 84. Our determination reflects that the
                            relevant service must itself be an “interconnected service,” and not merely a capability
                            to acquire interconnection. We further note that viewing broadband Internet access
                            service as a distinct service from application layer services that may be accessed by
                            it, even if the applications are pre-installed in the mobile device offered by the
                            provider, ensures that similar mobile broadband Internet access services are not
                            regulated in a disparate fashion based on what applications a particular provider
                            chooses to install in their offered devices. This is consistent with the fundamental
                            purpose under section 332 of regulatory symmetry between similar mobile services, and
                            also avoids regulatory inconsistencies that would result when mobile devices are brought
                            to a particular service provider by the consumer that do not include the provider’s
                            choice of pre-installed apps. While OTI New America argues that the need to obtain such
                            apps to make an interconnected call does not make mobile broadband Internet access
                            service different from traditional telephone service, which has always required customer
                            premises equipment to complete an interconnected call, <em>see </em>OTI New America Reply
                            at 56, we find the analogy inapt. With traditional CMRS, even where consumers obtain
                            their premises equipment or mobile devices separately, the function of interconnection
                            is provided by the purchased mobile service itself.

                            to revisit the <em>Title II Order</em>’s findings regarding functional equivalence.
                            <em>See </em>NTCH/Flat Wireless Comments at 16 (“Just as courts are bound by the earlier
                            decisions of the same court, the Commission cannot discard its prior decisions just
                            because it disagrees with them.”). In addition, we note that the <em>Title II Order</em>,
                            in reaching the conclusion that mobile broadband Internet access was a commercial mobile
                            service, relied in part on the need to avoid a statutory contradiction with its
                            determination that the service was a telecommunications service. <em>See Title II
                            Order</em>, 30 FCC Rcd at 5788, para. 403. Given our decision to restore the original
                            classification of mobile broadband Internet access service as an information service,
                            this change additionally warrants revisiting our conclusions with regard to the
                            classification of mobile broadband Internet access service under section 332.

                                meeting the definition of commercial mobile service are presumed to be not
                                functionally equivalent, a presumption particularly intuitive here in light of the
                                functional differences between traditional commercial mobile services like mobile
                                voice and today’s mobile broadband services. The evidence on demand substitutability
                                only reinforces this presumption. First, mobile broadband Internet access service
                                and traditional mobile voice services have different service characteristics and
                                intended use. Consumers purchase mobile broadband Internet access service to access
                                the Internet, on-line video, games, search engines, websites, and various other
                                applications, while they purchase mobile voice service solely to make calls to other
                                users using NANP numbers. Pricing and marketing information similarly support the
                                conclusion that today mobile broadband Internet access service and traditional
                                mobile voice services are not “closely substitutable.” Such evidence suggests, for
                                example, that mobile service providers target different types of customer groups
                                when advertising voice, as opposed to mobile broadband Internet access

                            <a href="#bookmark406" class="s31">Based on the record in this proceeding, we conclude
                                that economic theory, empirical studies, and observational evidence support
                                reclassification of broadband Internet access service as an information service
                                rather than the application of public-utility style regulation on ISPs. We find the
                                Title II classification likely has resulted, and will result, in considerable social
                                cost, in terms of foregone investment and innovation. At the same time,
                                classification of broadband Internet access service under Title II has had no
                                discernable incremental benefit relative to Title I
                                classification.</a><span class="s9">329</span><span class="s12"> </span>The
                            regulations promulgated under the Title II regime appear to have been a solution in
                            search of a problem. Close examination of the examples of harm cited by proponents of
                            Title II to justify heavy-handed regulation reveal that they are sparse and often
                            exaggerated. Moreover, economic incentives, including competitive pressures, support
                            Internet openness. We find that the gatekeeper theory, the bedrock of the <em>Title II
                            Order</em>’s overall argument justifying its approach, is a poor fit for the
                            broadband Internet access service market. Further, even if there may be potential harms,
                            we find that pre-existing legal remedies, particularly antitrust and consumer protection
                            laws, sufficiently address such harms so that they are outweighed by the well-recognized
                            disadvantages of public utility regulation. As such, we find that public policy
                            considerations support our legal finding that broadband Internet access service is an
                            information service under the Act.

                            The Commission has long recognized that regulatory burdens and uncertainty, such as
                            those inherent in Title II, can deter investment by regulated entities and, until the
                            <em>Title II Order</em><a href="#bookmark407" class="s31">, its regulatory framework for
                            cable, wireline, and wireless broadband Internet access services reflected that
                            reality.</a><span class="s9">330</span><span class="s12"> </span>This concern is
                            well-documented in the economics literature on regulatory theory, and the record also
                            supports the theory that the regulation imposed by Title II will negatively impact
                            investment. The balance of the evidence in the record suggests that Title II
                            classification has reduced ISP investment in the network, as well as hampered
                            innovation, because of regulatory uncertainty. The record also demonstrates that small
                            ISPs, many of which serve rural consumers, have been particularly harmed by Title II.
                            And there is no convincing evidence of increased investment in the edge that would
                            compensate for the reduction in network investment.

                            by the regulated entity are well- known in the regulatory economics literature. The
                            owners of network infrastructure make long-term, irreversible investments. In
                            theory, public utility regulation is intended to curb monopoly pricing just enough
                            that the firm earns a rate of return on its investments equivalent to what it would
                            earn in a competitive market. In practice, public utility regulation can depress
                            profits below the competitive rate of return for a variety of reasons. This
                            reduction in the expected return reduces the incentive to
                            invest.</a>332<span class="s12"> </span><a href="#bookmark411" class="s31">Importantly,
                            the risk that regulation might push returns below the competitive level also creates

                            United States’ ISP investment with ISP investment in Europe also suggests that ISP
                            investment might decline if the U.S., under the <em>Title II Order</em>, moves toward a
                            regulatory system more like Europe’s. A USTelecom research brief finds that European
                            investment per capita is about 50 percent lower than broadband investment in the U.S.
                            per capita. <em>See </em>Patrick Brogan, <em>Utility Regulation and Broadband Network
                            Investment: The EU and US Divide</em>, Research Brief (Apr. 25, 2017). As some
                            commenters point out, this study compares the U.S. with the much more regulatory
                            European system, which includes mandatory unbundling at regulated rates. Thus, it
                            presents a picture of how investment could change if the U.S. moves toward the European
                            system under Title II, not an assessment of the direct results of the <em>Title II
                            Order</em>. <em>See</em>, <em>e.g.</em>, AARP Comments at 60,; USTelecom at 1, The brief

                            might be larger than the change in broadband investment associated with the threat of
                            Title II regulation. Accordingly, the findings may be a more reliable indicator of the
                            direction of the change in investment than the absolute size of the change. At the very

                            heavy-handed Title II regulation. Nix <em>et al</em>. at 7. Again, this means Ford would
                            have underestimated the impacts of a move from pure absence of Title II regulation and
                            its threat. Finally, that same commenter asks, “why would ISP investment decline in

                                    that the same datasets were used to estimate 2010 and 2015 effects. Furthermore, we
                                    note that the Phoenix Center attempted to replicate the results of Table B1 and

                            Title II has depressed broadband investment is bolstered by other record evidence
                            showing that Title II stifled network innovation. Among the unseen social costs of
                            regulation are those broadband innovations and developments that never see the light
                            of day. ISP investment does not simply take the form of greater deployment, but can
                            also be directed toward new and more advanced services for consumers. Research and
                            development is an inherently risky part of any business, and the Commission’s
                            actions should not introduce greater uncertainty and risk into the process without a
                            clear need to do so. Numerous commenters have stated that the uncertainty regarding
                            what is allowed and what is not allowed under the new Title II broadband regime has
                            caused them to shelve projects that were in development, pursue fewer innovative
                            business models and arrangements, or delay rolling out new features or services.
                            Even large ISPs with significant resources have not been immune to the dampening
                            effect that uncertainty can have on a firm’s incentive to innovate. Charter, for

                            out-of-home Wi-Fi network, due in part to concerns about whether future
                            interpretations of Title II would allow Charter to continue to offer its Wi-Fi

                            OTI’s argument about AT&amp;T blocking Slingbox—which “redirected a TV signal” to the
                            iPhone app—from its 3G network in 2009 fails to provide support for Title II regulation
                            for a similar reason, because as AT&amp;T explained at the time, “we don’t restrict
                            users from going to a Web site that lets them view videos. But what our terms and
                            conditions prohibit is the transferring, or slinging, of a TV signal to their personal
                            computer or smartphone.” <em>See </em>Engadget, <em>AT&amp;T issues official statement on

                            In an attempt to manage its 3G network, AT&amp;T restricted slinging to Wi-Fi, while

                            <a name="bookmark525">We find it essential to take a holistic view of the market(s)
                                supplied by ISPs. ISPs, as well as edge providers, are important drivers of the
                                virtuous cycle, and regulation must be evaluated accounting for its impacts on ISPs’
                                capacity to drive that cycle, as well as that of edge providers. The underlying
                                economic model of the virtuous cycle is that of a two-sided market. In a two-sided
                                market, intermediaries—ISPs in our case—act as platforms facilitating interactions
                                between two different customer groups, or sides of the market—edge providers and end
                                users. The </a><em>Open Internet Order </em>takes the position that edge provider
                            innovation drives consumer adoption of Internet access and platform upgrades. The key
                            characteristic of a two-sided market, however, is that participants on each side of the
                            market value a platform service more as the number and/or quality of participants on the
                            platform’s other side increases. (The benefits subscribers on one side of the market
                            bring to the subscribers on the other, and <em>vice versa</em><a href="#bookmark529"

                            positive externalities.)</a><span class="s9">440</span><span class="s12"> </span>Thus,
                            rather than a single side driving the market, both sides generate network externalities,
                            and the platform provider profits by inducing both sides of the market to use its
                            platform. In maximizing profit, a platform provider sets prices and invests in network
                            extension and innovation to maximize the gain subscribers (and potential subscribers) on
                            both sides of the market obtain in interacting across the platform, subject to costs and
                            competitive conditions. Any analysis of such a market must account for each side of the
                            market and the platform provider.

                                    suggests a secondary reason: ISPs “will typically not take into account the effect

                                In a two-sided market, three potential reasons for Title II regulation arise: the

                                ISP’s subscribers (end users), which seems to primarily be what the Commission and
                                others appear to be referring when using the term “gatekeeper”; and the extent to

                            is generally procompetitive, it is of course possible to imagine isolated scenarios in
                            which a vertically integrated ISP/MVPD would have the incentive and ability to engage in
                            anticompetitive conduct. But such scenarios could arise only where the firm dominates
                            (or likely will dominate) all relevant markets, both upstream and downstream. If there
                            are firms that actually possess such market power in specific geographic areas . . . the
                            proper regulatory response would be to keep <em>those dominant firms </em>from
                            anticompetitively excluding <em>OVD competition</em>, as antitrust law already does. . . .
                            The proper response is <em>not </em>to restrict the ability of <em>all </em>ISPs (dominant
                            or not) to engage in <em>any </em>differential treatment (anticompetitive or not) among
                            <em>any </em>edge providers (ISP rivals or not).”).

                            This table understates competition in several respects. First, even two competing
                            wireline ISPs place considerable, if not always fully effective, competitive constraints
                            on each other. ISPs’ substantial sunk costs imply that competition between even two ISPs
                            is likely to be relatively strong. Thus, to the extent market power exists, it is
                            unlikely to significantly distort what would otherwise be efficient choices. A wireline
                            ISP, anywhere it is active, necessarily has made substantial

                                circumstances) and reputationally expensive (e.g., even if behavior is confined to
                                an uncompetitive market, customers in competitive markets may churn after learning
                                about such behavior). Accordingly (and unsurprisingly), most ISPs actively try to
                                minimize the discrepancies in their terms of service, network management practices,
                                billing systems, and other policies—even if they offer different service tiers or
                                pricing in different areas. Approximately 79 percent of US households are found in
                                census blocks that at least two wireline ISPs report serving, and approximately
                                another 7 percent of households are in census blocks where the unique wireline ISP
                                providing service in the census block faces competition from a rival in 90 percent
                                of the blocks it services.</a><a href="#bookmark551" class="s11">461</a>

                            Economic Declaration at 26–27 (“[T]he fact that providers actively compete to steal
                            customers from one another demonstrates that they have available capacity with which to
                            serve those customers. The ability to switch fixed access providers is demonstrated by
                            the fact that churn is an important strategic focus in the broadband Internet access
                            industry. The focus on reducing churn is evident in providers’ focus on “save desk”
                            efforts. Customers thinking about leaving their Internet service provider must call to
                            disconnect service, and they are then referred to save desks that will offer substantial
                            discounts or other inducements to persuade the customer to stay. This is competition in
                            action; the ability to switch leads firms to offer substantial inducements to stay, thus
                            benefiting even those customers who ultimately choose not to switch. . . . Finally, as
                            with wireless, search costs are very low in this industry, as there is no shortage of
                            comparative advertising, including direct mailing and circulars.”). On the substantial

                            cross-platform or intermodal competition between multiple broadband technologies.

                            ‘smartphone-only’ internet users—meaning they own a smartphone, but do not have
                            traditional home broadband service.” That trend is likely to continue with the roll-out
                            of affordable mobile plans with unlimited data (see above) and the ubiquitous
                            availability of public Wi-Fi hotspots.”); AT&amp;T Economic Declaration at 29–34

                            only at wireline options), and thus further increasing the intensity of competition. . .
                            . Moreover, when comparing wireless and wireline speeds, it is important to note that
                            while a wireline connection may be shared between multiple users, wireless connections
                            are typically measured on a per device basis, so two smart phone users in a household
                            may each be taking advantage of 25 Mbps connections on their phones, while a landline
                            connection in the home may be 25 Mbps and be shared between the two.”).

                            Competition constrains a firm’s prices if the firm is prevented from raising price to
                            levels that absent switching to competitors, would increase the firm’s profits. The
                            extent of the switching need not be large. For example, with constant unit costs, a 5%
                            price increase would be prevented if that would lead to slightly less than 5% of the
                            firm’s customers to either stop consuming altogether or to switch to a rival. Suppliers
                            of Internet access service are likely to be more sensitive to customer loss than the
                            case with constant marginal cost, since in general the marginal costs of Internet access
                            service fall as subscriber numbers increase, meaning, in addition to the revenues lost
                            due to leaving customers, profits are also eroded due to a rise in the average cost of
                            supplying those who remain. <em>See infra</em>, n.455.

                            The focus on edge providers’ bargaining position vis-à-vis ISPs is warranted in light of
                            the fact that any gatekeeper power applies to edge providers, not end users. <em>See </em>USTelecom

                            third parties. With respect to customers or end users, therefore, the gatekeeper theory
                            is inapt, and the proper question that the Commission should ask is whether broadband

                                economically inefficient. A terminating (access) monopoly arises when customers on
                                one side of the market, roughly speaking end users in our case, single home with
                                little prospect of switching to another platform in the short run, while customers
                                on the other side, roughly speaking edge providers in our case, find it worthwhile
                                to multi-home. The terminating monopoly differs from conventional market power
                                because it can arise despite effective competition between platforms. In that case,
                                platforms must vigorously compete for single-homing end users, but have less need to
                                compete for edge providers, who subscribe to all

                            terminating monopoly problem in voice telecommunications is one created by
                            common-carriage regulation, not one solved by it. Specifically, carriers must
                            interconnect with each other and originating carriers must pay terminating carriers
                            rates set by the terminating carrier in their tariff (with some government oversight).
                            That leads to a “bargaining” situation where one party sets the terms of the deal and
                            the other must accept it or complain to the regulator—in other words, the regulations
                            prohibit a normal free market from developing. Such regulatory requirements do not exist
                            in broadband. <em>See </em>AT&amp;T Comments at 32-33 &amp; n.62 (“As the Commission
                            ultimately acknowledged, however, this “[]LEC access charge” problem arose not from a
                            market failure, but from the application of Title II regulation itself—specifically,
                            from tariffing, interconnection, and geographic-averaging requirements. . . . The
                            broadband market contains no such regulatory distortions and presents no “terminating
                            access monopoly.” <em>. . . </em>No broadband ISP can “tariff” the “service” of providing
                            access to its end users, and no backbone or other third-party network has any regulatory
                            obligation to interconnect with any ISP, let alone pay whatever rates the ISP might wish
                            to charge for access to its users.”); AT&amp;T Economic Declaration at 35 (““terminating
                            access” problems are not market failures to be ameliorated by regulatory intervention,
                            but are actually market distortions <em>created by </em>regulation, most notably in the
                            context of landline voice long-distance services. In that context, [IXCs] required
                            access to [LEC] networks to terminate calls. LECs could charge high fees for that access
                            and the IXCs were required to pay those fees. The IXCs could not charge their own
                            customers different fees based on the LEC fees, and the LEC customers had no direct
                            relationship with the IXCs. Because the end users did not have to bear the higher costs,
                            they had no reason to switch to an alternative terminating access provider, which
                            arguably gave their local provider market power in the provision of terminating access
                            service. In contrast, if an Internet Service Provider attempted to block or throttle
                            specific content, its end user customers would be directly affected by, and could
                            directly observe, that behavior, and they would have the incentive and ability to react
                            to that conduct. The same is true if an Internet Service Provider attempted to impose
                            discriminatory charges on particular content providers[].”).

                            Furthermore, two additional aspects unique to the traditional telephone market created
                            those problems: (1) Voice call originators, who are (with the exception of reverse
                            charge calls) the analogue to edge providers in voice- telecommunications, do not
                            directly negotiate with the carrier that sets call termination charges, but rather only
                            have a relationship with the call originating carrier. However, the originating carrier
                            gains from high call termination charges when it terminates calls on its own network, so
                            faces a conflict of interest when negotiating call termination charges on behalf of its
                            subscribers. In fact, such a regime provides carriers with a mechanism for using the
                            input price of call termination to collude on retail prices. <em>See, e.g.</em>, M. Carter
                            and J. Wright, <em>Interconnection in Network Industries</em>, Rev. of Industrial
                            Economics, 1999 14 (1) 1-25; J.S. Gans and S.P. King, <em>Using ‘bill and keep’
                            interconnect Arrangements to Soften Network Competition</em>, Economic Letters 71 (3)
                            2001, 413-420; J-J. Laffont, P. Rey and J. Tirole, <em>Network Competition: I. Overview
                            and Nondiscriminatory Pricing</em>, The RAND Journal of Economics, 29 (1) 1998, 1-37;
                            Verizon Economic Declaration at 33–34. In contrast, edge providers can directly connect
                            with an ISP to reach that ISP’s end users, without seeking the ISP’s help to terminate
                            on another ISP’s network (unlike in voice telecommunications), or can use intermediaries
                            such as Cogent and Akamai, who largely do not terminate traffic to their own end users,
                            so do not face the conflict that voice carriers face when negotiating termination
                            charges. (2) Even if call originating carriers had good incentives to negotiate
                            reasonable termination charges, regulation that requires interconnection, but does not
                            appropriately regulate termination charges, seriously weakens their ability to obtain
                            reasonable rates. Threatening to not interconnect is not an available negotiating ploy
                            in telecommunications, but is one available to edge providers, especially larger ones,
                            in negotiating with ISPs.

                            Moreover, historically voice telephony consisted of geographic monopolies, making it
                            pointless for one carrier to threaten another with disconnection since the end users of
                            the disconnected carrier could not switch to a different carrier. Again, this is not
                            true for Internet access.

                                    vertically-integrated ISP could collude with its affiliated content arm without fear
                                    of the antitrust laws. EFF Comments at 12. This argument is inapposite, however,
                                    because such a claim against a vertically-integrated ISP would likely be based on
                                    Section 2 of the Sherman Act under an attempted monopolization theory, rather than
                                    as a Section 1 collusion claim.</span>

                            we have confidence that the use of antitrust enforcement to protect competition in

                            to reap the benefits of that competition. We conclude that the light-touch approach
                            that we adopt today, in combination with existing antitrust and consumer protection
                            laws, more than adequately addresses concerns about Internet openness, particularly
                            as compared to the rigidity of Title II.</a><a href="#bookmark646"

                            benefits of antitrust law is its strong focus on protecting competition and
                            consumers. If a particular practice benefits consumers, antitrust law will not
                            condemn it. The fact that antitrust law protects competition means that it also
                            protects other qualities that consumers value. “[The] assumption that competition is
                            the best method of allocating resources in a free market recognizes that all
                            elements of a bargain—quality, service, safety, and durability—and not just the
                            immediate cost, are favorably affected by the free opportunity to select among
                            alternative offers.”</a><span class="s9">553</span> <span class="s3">The market
                                    competition that antitrust law preserves will protect values such as free

                            to address its statutory authority after the 2010 <em>Comcast </em>decision, the
                            Commission instead attempted increasingly-regulatory approaches under existing statutory
                            provisions, culminating in the <em>Title II Order</em>’s application of a legal regime
                            that was ill-suited for broadband Internet access service. Returning to the Commission’s
                            historically sound approach to interpreting and applying the Act to broadband Internet
                            access service corrects what we see as shortcomings in how the Commission, in the recent
                            past, conceptualized its role in this context.

                            preemption is contrary to section 706(a) of the 1996 Act, 47 U.S.C. § 1302(a), insofar
                            as that provision directs state commissions (as well as this Commission) to promote the
                            deployment of advanced telecommunications capability. <em>See, e.g.</em>, NARUC Comments
                            at 2; Public Knowledge Reply at 27. For one thing, as discussed <em>infra</em>, we
                            conclude that section 706 does not constitute an affirmative grant of regulatory
                            authority, but instead simply provides guidance to this Commission and the state
                            commissions on how to use any authority conferred by other provisions of federal and
                            state law. <em>See infra </em><a href="#bookmark1068" class="s16">Part </a>IV.B.3.a. For
                            another, nothing in this order forecloses state regulatory commissions with jurisdiction
                            over broadband service from promoting the goals set forth in section 706(a) through
                            measures that we do not preempt here, such as by promoting access to rights-of-way under
                            state law, encouraging broadband investment and deployment through state tax policy, and
                            administering other generally applicable state laws. Finally, insofar as we conclude
                            that section 706’s goals of encouraging broadband deployment and removing barriers to
                            infrastructure investment are best served by preempting state regulation, we find that
                            section 706 <em>supports </em>(rather than prohibits) the use of preemption here.

                                apply different rules in each circumstance. Accordingly, an ISP generally could not

                                    FCC Rcd at 5828, para. 473. Congress adopted the CVAA after recognizing that
                                    “Internet- based and digital technologies . . . driven by growth in broadband . . .
                                    are now pervasive, offering innovative and exciting ways to communicate and share
                                    information.” S. Rep. No. 111–386, at 1 (2010); H.R. Rep. No. 111-563, at 19 (2010).
                                    Congress thus clearly had Internet-based communications technologies in mind when
                                    enacting the accessibility provisions of Section 716 (as well as the related
                                    provisions of sections 717-718) and in providing important protections with respect

                        and honor this longstanding, bipartisan commitment by adopting a light-touch framework that
                        will preserve Internet freedom for all Americans.

                        To implement that light-touch framework, we next reevaluate the rules and enforcement regime
                        adopted in the <em>Title II Order</em>. That reevaluation is informed—as it must be—by the
                        return of jurisdiction to the Federal Trade Commission to police ISPs for anticompetitive
                        acts or unfair and deceptive practices. Against that backdrop, we first decide to retain the
                        transparency rule adopted in the <em>Open Internet Order </em>with slight modifications.
                        History has shown that transparency is critical to openness—consumers and entrepreneurs are
                        not afraid to make their voices heard when ISPs engage in practices to which they object.
                        And we conclude that preexisting federal protections—alongside the transparency rule we
                        adopt today—are not only sufficient to protect Internet freedom, but will do so more
                        effectively and at lower social cost than the <em>Title II Order</em>’s conduct rules. In
                        short, we believe the light- touch framework we adopt today will pave the way for additional
                        innovation and investment that will facilitate greater consumer access to more content,
                        services, and devices, and greater competition.

                        be “onerous.” Further, as discussed above, we find that a transparency requirement is
                        necessary and sufficient to protect Internet openness, given that we lack authority to adopt

                        Open Internet Order</em>, “a key factor in determining whether a service is used to evade
                        the scope of the rules is whether the service is used as a substitute for broadband Internet
                        access service. For example, an Internet access service that provides access to a
                        substantial subset of Internet endpoints based on end users’ preference to avoid certain
                        content, applications, or services; Internet access services that allow some uses of the
                        Internet (such as access to the World Wide Web) but not others (such as email); or a ‘Best
                        of the Web’ Internet access service that provides access to 100 top websites could not be
                        used to evade the open Internet rules applicable to ‘broadband Internet access service.’”

                            Means of Disclosure. <span class="s3">The Commission relies on broadband Internet access
                                    service provider disclosures to identify market-entry barriers for entrepreneurs and
                                    small businesses and ensure consumers have the information they need in selecting an
                                    ISP. And given the sheer number of ISPs offering service throughout the
                                    country—4,559 at last count—we believe the most effective way to monitor for any
                                    such barriers is to require the public disclosure of an ISP’s practices so that
                                    Commission staff can review them while letting consumers, entrepreneurs, and other
                                    small businesses report to the Commission any market-barriers they discover.
                                    Accordingly, ISPs must publicly disclose the information required by our
                                    transparency rule.</span>

                                Consistent with Commission precedent, we expect that ISPs will make disclosures in a

                            For example, if ISPs do not disclose key details of how they provide broadband
                            Internet access service, that could leave entrepreneurs and small businesses
                            participating in the Internet marketplace unable to determine how well particular
                            existing or contemplated offerings are likely to perform for users, and thus unable

                            customers to make the offering viable. Such undisclosed practices also can leave

                            best meet their needs given the applications and service they wish to use. As a
                            result, even if a sufficient number of consumers theoretically are accessible by a
                            broadband Internet access service offering with sufficient technical characteristics

                            business’s entry into the market for that service could be undermined if consumers

                            Order </em>also relied on its Title III licensing authority for disclosure rules for
                            mobile ISPs. <em>Open Internet Order</em>, 25 FCC Rcd at 17979, para. 134. We likewise
                            rely on Title III licensing authority for our disclosure rule here. As with section 257,
                            commenters do not dispute that our disclosure requirements advance the objectives of
                            section 218 and the relevant Title III provisions. Insofar as the <em>Open Internet
                            Order </em>cited other authority as supporting all its rules— implicitly encompassing
                            the disclosure requirements as well as conduct rules—we do not rely on those additional
                            claims of authority given our concerns about the merits of those theories on the record

                            stated above, ISPs have two options for complying with the transparency requirements.
                            One is to make the disclosures on a publicly available, easily accessible website.

                            and Title III of the Communications Act. We also observe in this regard that the most

                            general conduct rule and the prohibitions on paid prioritization, blocking, and
                            throttling. We do so for three reasons. First, the transparency rule we adopt, in
                            combination with the state of broadband Internet access service competition and the
                            antitrust and consumer protection laws, obviates the need for conduct rules by achieving
                            comparable benefits at lower cost. Second, scrutinizing closely each prior conduct rule,
                            we find that the costs of each rule outweigh its benefits. Third, the record does not
                            identify any legal authority to adopt conduct rules for all ISPs, and we decline to

                            users use more data or require lower latency; this may be the case, for example,
                            with high-bandwidth applications such as Netflix, which in the first half of 2016

                            ISPs must recover these costs solely from end users, but ISPs cannot always set
                            prices targeted at the relevant end users. The resulting prices create
                            inefficiencies. Consumers who do not cause these costs must pay for them, and end
                            users who do cause these costs to some degree free-ride, inefficiently distorting
                            usage of both groups. When paid prioritization signals to edge providers the costs
                            their content or applications cause, edge providers can undertake actions that would
                            improve the efficiency of the two-sided market. For example, they could invest in
                            compression technologies if those come at a lower cost than paid prioritization,
                            enhancing efficiency, or, if they have a pricing relationship with their end users,
                            they could directly charge the end user for priority, leading those end users to
                            adjust their usage if the user’s value does not exceed the service’s cost, again

                                is more profitable because the ISP can now charge edge providers in addition to
                                subscribers, and paid prioritization allows more edge providers who need a high

                            <a href="#bookmark1043" class="s31">Lastly, antitrust laws would not prevent an ISP from
                                exercising legally-acquired market power to earn market rents, so long as it is not
                                used anticompetitively, but we do not consider any harms that might result from this
                                to be so large as to justify the harms that a total prohibition on paid
                                prioritization would entail. For harms from exercising legally-acquired market power
                                to arise, the ISP must have market power over the edge provider. However, as shown
                                above, ISPs usually face at least moderate competition, and all the more so taking a
                                medium-term perspective. Consequently, the harms that could possibly occur from
                                exercise of such power are not likely to be large. Further, the extent to which any
                                harms actually occur will be muted by two factors. First, ISPs have strong
                                incentives to keep edge provider output high (as this increases the value end users
                                see in subscribing to the ISP, and signals to edge providers that the ISP recognizes
                                their contribution to the
                                platform).</a>938<span class="s12"> </span><a href="#bookmark1044" class="s31">Thus,
                            harm will only occur to the extent the ISP is unable to devise pricing schemes that
                            preserve edge providers’ incentives to bring content while maximizing the ISP’s
                            profit (the exercise of market power is only harmful when it excludes what would
                            otherwise be efficient purchases of access). Second, as discussed above, increased
                            prices from edge providers are to a potentially significant extent passed through to
                            end users in the form of lower prices for broadband Internet access service, with
                            the result that end user demand for edge provider content is increased. The extent
                            of such pass-through offsets these harms.</a>939<span class="s12"> </span><span

                            benefits at lower cost. In addition, several factors specific to blocking and

                            and throttling. First, most attempts by ISPs to block or throttle content will

                            The record in this proceeding does not persuade us that there are any sources of
                            statutory authority that individually, or in the aggregate, could support conduct rules
                            uniformly encompassing all ISPs. We find that provisions in section 706 of the 1996 Act
                            directing the Commission to encourage deployment of advanced telecommunications
                            capability are better interpreted as hortatory rather than as independent grants of
                            regulatory authority. We also are not persuaded that section 230 of the Communications
                            Act is a grant of regulatory authority that could provide the basis for conduct rules
                            here. Nor does the record here reveal other sources of authority that collectively would
                            provide a sure foundation for conduct rules that would treat all similarly-situated ISPs

                            We conclude that the directives to the Commission in section 706(a) and (b) of the 1996
                            Act to promote deployment of advanced telecommunications capability are better
                            interpreted as hortatory, and not as grants of regulatory authority. We thus depart from
                            the interpretation of those provisions adopted by the Commission beginning in the <em>Open
                            Internet Order</em>, and return to a reading of that language in section 706 of the
                            1996 Act consistent with the Commission’s original interpretation.

                            provides a general, ongoing exhortation for the Commission to encourage deployment of
                            advanced telecommunications capability through exercise of other authority, while
                            section 706(b) directs the Commission to do so by taking “immediate action” in the event
                            of a negative finding under the section 706(b) inquiry. 47 U.S.C. § 1302(a), (b). The
                            direction in section 706(b) of the 1996 Act that the Commission exercise other authority
                            by taking “immediate action” in the event of a negative finding under the section 706(b)
                            inquiry could, for example, form part of the basis for petition(s) for Commission
                            rulemaking based on such other authority in the wake of a negative finding in the
                            section 706(b) inquiry. Although the Tenth Circuit concluded that the possibility of
                            such an interpretation of section 706(b) would not unambiguously compel the conclusion
                            that the provision is hortatory, the court’s decision does not limit our ability to rely
                            on that as a factor that persuades us that section 706(b) is better read as hortatory.

                            Indeed, under the <em>Open Internet Order</em><a href="#bookmark1084" class="s31">’s
                            theory of section 706(a) and (b) as independent grants of authority, the Commission
                            could rely on those provisions to impose duties or adopt regulations equivalent to
                            those directly addressed by the provisions of the Communications Act focused on
                            promoting competition and/or deployment that go beyond the entities, contexts, and
                            circumstances that bounded the Communications Act provisions. Section 706(a) and (b)
                            direct the Commission to promote competition in the local telecommunications market
                            and otherwise encourage the deployment of advanced telecommunications capability.
                            Promoting local competition and/or encouraging the deployment of telecommunications
                            networks likewise are key objectives of a number of provisions added to the
                            Communications Act by the 1996 Act, each of which were limited in scope to address
                            the actions of particular, defined entities and were triggered in particular,

                            one factor persuading us that section 706 of the 1996 Act is better read as hortatory is
                            not undercut by our reliance on section 257 as authority for disclosure requirements

                            investment while also helping mitigate any such barriers. Although section 257 does not
                            expressly identify entities from which we can obtain information, other aspects of
                            section 257 persuade us that our interpretation of that provision as a grant of
                            authority to obtain the information we require from ISPs is necessary for us to carry

                            arguments that we should wait on the completion of the latest inquiry under section
                            706(b) before evaluating the interpretation of section 706. <em>See, e.g.</em>, New
                            America Foundation Reply at 21-22. Under the prior interpretation, section 706(a) was a
                            grant of authority independent of section 706(b), and particularly insofar as we would
                            not interpret section 706(b) as a grant of authority in any case, we see no reason to
                            wait on the results of the inquiry under that provision.

                            statutory context. If Congress wishes to give the Commission more explicit direction
                            to impose certain conduct rules on ISPs, or to impose such rules itself within
                            constitutional limits, it is of course free to do so. We decline to read such
                            wide-ranging authority, however, into provisions that, on our reading today, are
                            merely hortatory, and are at best ambiguous.</a><a href="#bookmark1122" class="s11">1014</a>

                            Independently, we also are not persuaded that the prior interpretation of section 706(a)
                            and (b) of the 1996 Act would better advance policy goals relevant here. We have other
                            sources of authority on which to ground our transparency requirements without adopting
                            an inferior interpretation of section 706(a) and (b). With respect to conduct rules, in
                            addition to our decision that limits on our legal authority counsel against adopting
                            such rules, we separately find that such rules are not otherwise justified by the record
                            here. Consequently, we need not stretch the words of section 706 of the 1996 Act because
                            we can protect Internet freedom even without it. Rather, we are persuaded to act in the
                            manner that we believe reflects the best interpretation given the text and structure of
                            the Act, the legislative history, and the policy implications of alternative

                            monitoring traffic are premised on a reading of section 275 as a far broader mandate
                            to protecting alarm monitoring competition than the specifics of its language

                            program carriage agreements and thus subject to the restrictions in section 616(a)
                            of the Act.</a><span class="s9">1036</span><span class="s12"> </span>That expansive

                            between video programming vendors and MVPDs. But the <em>Open Internet

                            allowing ISPs to enter paid prioritization arrangements, even if subject to a commercial
                            reasonableness standard, would trigger First Amendment scrutiny as a restriction on

                            Sandoval Aug. 30, 2017 <em>Ex Parte </em>Letter, Exh. C at 5-6. The failure to restrict
                            ISPs’ actions through conduct rules does not require ISPs to act in any particular
                            manner, and those arguments do not reveal why allowing ISPs to decide whether and when
                            to enter paid prioritization arrangements would constitute state action triggering the

                            In addition, the absence of demonstrated statutory authority that could support
                            comprehensive conduct rules would leave us with, at most, a patchwork of non-uniform
                            rules that would have problematic consequences and doubtful value. Virtually all of the
                            remaining sources of possible authority identified in the <em>Open Internet Order </em>or
                            the record here would encompass only discrete subsets of ISPs, such as ISPs that
                            otherwise are providing common carrier voice services; ISPs that otherwise are cable
                            operators or MVPDs; or ISPs that hold wireless licenses, among others. Individually,
                            each of these sources of authority would leave substantial segments of ISPs unaddressed
                            by any conduct rules. In addition, most of the remaining sources of authority would, at
                            most, enable the Commission to target narrow types of behaviors, including, among other
                            examples, actions by ISPs that otherwise offer common carrier voice services to
                            interfere with competing over-the-top voice services or actions by certain ISPs that
                            otherwise are video providers that harm the distribution of satellite programming.
                            Importantly, substantial questions also remain on the record here about the merits of
                            most of those theories of legal authority. For example, most if not all wired ISPs would
                            appear to fall outside the scope of any sound basis of authority for conduct rules
                            addressing the theories of harm identified in the <em>Open
                            Internet</em><a href="#bookmark1161" class="s31">. This would leave substantial

                            marketplace in a manner equivalent to other ISPs. ISPs subject to conduct rules would be
                            limited in the ways in which they could manage traffic on their networks and/or the
                            commercial arrangements they could enter related to their carriage of traffic beyond the
                            requirements to which other ISPs are subject. As a result, they are likely to face
                            increased network costs and network management challenges and see decreased revenue
                            opportunities from commercial arrangements relative to existing or potential competitors

                        To conduct the cost-benefit analysis, we first consider the question of maintaining the
                        Title II classification of broadband Internet access service. We next consider approaches to
                        transparency. Then to evaluate the Internet conduct rule and the bright-line rules, we
                        assume that we will not maintain the Title II classification and we will adopt our
                        transparency rule. This approach allows us practically to evaluate the rules in a way that
                        incorporates the decisions on classification and transparency that we have come to in this

                        that the Title II classification did directionally decrease investment by ISPs.</a><a

                        maintaining the <em>status quo </em><a href="#bookmark1195" class="s31">[i.e., Title II
                        classification] result from decreased value derived from using the networks.”</a><span
                            class="s9">1083</span><span class="s12"> </span>Ideally, we would estimate consumers’
                        and businesses’ valuations of the service or service improvements foregone caused by Title
                        II classification. Unfortunately, the record before us does not allow for such estimation.
                        We can reasonably conclude, however, that providers expect to recoup their investments over
                        time through revenues generated by employing the networks resulting from the investment.
                        Since these revenues come from consumers and businesses who are willing to pay <em>at
                        least </em>their value of the service, the investment foregone due to Title II is a lower
                        bound on the costs of maintaining the classification. This is a conservative estimate of the
                        social welfare impact because frequently (1) a customer’s willingness to pay exceeds what
                        the customer actually pays, and (2) the provider may make an economic profit. These
                        likelihoods both would increase the private costs associated with foregone investment due to
                        maintaining Title II classification. We therefore conclude that the private costs of
                        maintaining a Title II classification due to foregone networks are directionally negative
                        and likely constitute at least several billion dollars annually based on the record.

                        broadband Internet access service under Title II and adopted rules simultaneously, it is
                        difficult methodologically to make a clear delineation between the effect of the

                        Next, we consider the benefits associated with maintaining the Title II classification. The
                        relevant comparison is what incremental benefit the Title II classification provides over
                        and above the Title I scenario. In the Title I scenario, the FTC has jurisdiction over
                        broadband Internet access service providers. The record does not convince us that Title II
                        classification <em>per se </em>provides any benefit over and above Title I classification. We
                        also find above that the record does not provide evidence supporting the conclusion that the
                        Title II classification affects edge investment. To the extent Title II provides a benefit,
                        it appears to do so by serving as a legal basis relied upon to adopt rules. Therefore, in

                                our decision to classify under Title I, the benefits of a transparency rule are expected
                                to be of considerable magnitude since it is a key element of our approach of relying on
                                enforcement under antitrust and consumer protection law to prevent and remedy harmful
                                behaviors by ISPs. Numerous commenters indicate the benefits of a free and open Internet
                                are large, so to the extent a transparency rule under our Title I approach is important
                                for maintaining a free and open Internet, we can conclude the benefits are positive and
                                considerable. Furthermore, transparency can provide other benefits in terms of consumer
                                welfare. Namely, if transparency helps mitigate economic deadweight loss due to
                                information asymmetry or if it helps consumers better satisfy their preferences in their
                                purchasing decisions, then additional benefits will accrue. We therefore conclude that
                                our transparency approach, as well as the transparency approaches in the 2010 </span>Open

                            Internet conduct standard would impose net negative benefits. The costs of the rule are
                            considerable as the evidence shows that it had large effects on consumers obtaining
                            innovative services (as demonstrated by the zero- rating experiences). The innovations
                            that were delayed or never brought to market would likely have cost many millions or
                            even billions of dollars in lost consumer welfare. At the same time, for the reasons
                            explained already, the benefits of the conduct rule are approximately zero. This leads

                                    against online video providers in 2009 and 2010 shines little light on its

                                in its prior transaction decisions were cited as part of a larger group of
                                mostly publicly available information.</a>1111<span class="s12"> </span><span

                                broadband Internet access service as an information service is quite different from
                                the analysis the Commission employs when conducting a transaction review. In this
                                rulemaking, we are not considering whether, as a result of a transfer of a
                                Commission license, a licensee is likely to gain market power, allowing it to take
                                anticompetitive actions that it otherwise could not. Instead, we are reasonably
                                considering the long-term costs and benefits of Title II and other <em>ex ante </em>regulation
                                in an increasingly dynamic market. As such, we choose a conservative and
                                administrable approach to formulating a light- touch regulatory framework—which is
                                appropriate in a rulemaking.

                                contained in this proceeding. In addition, we note that pursuant to the Small

                                3506(c)(4), we previously sought specific comment on how the Commission might
                                further reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns with
                                fewer than 25 employees.

                                In this present document, we require any person providing broadband Internet access
                                service to publicly disclose accurate information regarding the network management
                                practices, performance, and commercial terms of their broadband Internet access
                                services sufficient to enable the Commission to identify market entry barriers and
                                for consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of such
                                services and entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and
                                maintain Internet offerings. We have assessed the effects of this rule and find that
                                any burden on small businesses will be minimal because (1) the rule gives broadband
                                providers flexibility in how to implement the disclosure rule, (2) the rule gives
                                providers adequate time to develop cost-effective methods of compliance, and (3) the
                                rule eliminates the additional reporting obligations adopted in the <em>Title II
                                Order</em>.

                    The transparency rule we adopt is necessary because properly tailored transparency disclosures
                    provide valuable information to the Commission to enable it to meet its statutory obligation to
                    observe the communications marketplace to monitor the introduction of new services and
                    technologies, and to identify and eliminate potential marketplace barriers for the provision of
                    information service. Such disclosures also provide valuable information to other Internet
                    ecosystem participants; transparency substantially reduces the possibility that ISPs will engage
                    in harmful practices, and it incentivizes quick corrective measures by providers if problematic

                    consumers make informed choices about their purchase and use of broadband services. Moreover,
                    clear disclosures improve consumer confidence in ISPs’ practices, ultimately increasing user
                    adoption and leading to additional investment and innovation, while providing startups and other
                    edge providers the necessary information to innovate and improve products.

                    Our enforcement changes will ensure that ISPs will be held accountable for any violations of the
                    transparency rule. We eliminate the formal complaint procedures because the informal complaint
                    procedure, in conjunction with other redress options including consumer protection laws, will
                    sufficiently protect consumers. Additionally, we eliminate the position of Open Internet
                    Ombudsperson because the staff from the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau—other than the
                    Ombudsperson— have been performing the Ombudsperson functions envisioned by the <em>Title II
                    Order</em>. We also eliminate the issuance of enforcement advisory opinions, because
                    enforcement advisory opinions do not diminish regulatory uncertainty, particularly for small
                    providers. Instead, they add costs and uncertain timelines since there is no specific timeframe
                    within which to act, which can also inhibit innovation.

                    We return mobile broadband Internet access service to its original classification as a private
                    mobile radio service because we find that the definitions of the terms “public switched network”
                    and “interconnected service” that the Commission adopted in the 1994 <em>Second CMRS Report and
                    Order </em>reflect a better reading of the Act. Accordingly, we readopt those definitions.

                <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">
                    We restore the definition of interconnected service that existed prior to the <em>Title II
                    Order</em>. Prior to that Order, the term “interconnected service” was defined under the
                    Commission’s rules as a service “that gives subscribers the capability to communicate to or
                    receive communication from <em>all </em>other users on the public switched network.” The <em>Title
                    II Order </em>modified this definition by deleting the word “all,” finding that mobile
                    broadband Internet access service should still be considered an interconnected service even if
                    it only enabled users to communicate with “some” other users of the public switched network
                    rather than all. We conclude that the better reading of “interconnected service” is one that
                    enables communication between its users and all other users of the public switched network.

                    The broadband Internet access service provider industry has changed since this definition was
                    introduced in 2007. The data cited above may therefore include entities that no longer provide
                    broadband Internet access service, and may exclude entities that now provide such service. To
                    ensure that this FRFA describes the universe of small entities that our action might affect, we
                    discuss in turn several different types of entities that might be providing broadband Internet
                    access service. We note that, although we have no specific information on the number of small
                    entities that provide broadband Internet access service over unlicensed spectrum, we include
                    these entities in our Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.

            bands,</a><span class="s9">1270 </span><a href="#bookmark1393" class="s31">the Commission has
            defined a “small business” as an entity with average annual gross revenues for the preceding three
            years not exceeding $40 million, and a “very small business” as an entity with average annual gross
            revenues for the preceding three years not exceeding $15 million. For AWS-2 and AWS-3, although we
            do not know for certain which entities are likely to apply for these frequencies, we note that the
            AWS-1 bands are comparable to those used for cellular service and personal communications service.
            The Commission has not yet adopted size standards for the AWS-2 or AWS-3 bands but proposes to treat
            both AWS-2 and AWS-3 similarly to broadband PCS service and AWS-1 service due to the comparable
            capital requirements and other factors, such as issues involved in relocating incumbents and
            developing markets, technologies, and services.</a><a href="#bookmark1393" class="s11">1271</a>

                            been granted and more than 7433 sites have been registered. The Commission has not developed

                        Broadband Internet access service providers must disclose performance characteristics,
                        network practices, and commercial terms. The required disclosures must either be posted on a

                        Additionally, the removal of the additional reporting obligations, the direct notification
                        requirement, and the broadband provider safe harbor form will minimize the burdens providers
                        face.

                        The transparency rule we adopt today strikes an appropriate balance by requiring broadband
                        Internet access service providers to disclose information that will allow consumers to make
                        informed choices and that will enable the Commission to enable it to meet its statutory
                        obligation to observe the communications marketplace to monitor the introduction of new
                        services and technologies and to identify and eliminate potential marketplace barriers for
                        the provision of information service, while simultaneously freeing providers from onerous
                        burdens that produce little public benefit. While retaining the transparency rule, with
                        modifications, from the <em>Open Internet Order</em>, we eliminate the additional reporting
                        obligations, the direct notification requirements, and the broadband label “safe harbor,”
                        all of which will reduce the burdens of broadband Internet access service providers. The
                        additional reporting obligations, the direct notification requirement, and the “safe harbor”
                        all required providers to expend significant resources without a corresponding gain to
                        consumers, entrepreneurs, or other small businesses.

                    <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">
                        We also eliminate several rules adopted in the <em>Title II Order</em>, including the general
                        conduct standard, the ban on paid prioritization, and the no-blocking/no-throttling rule. We
                        eliminate these rules for three reasons. First, the transparency rule we adopt, in
                        combination with the state of broadband Internet access service competition and the
                        antitrust and consumer protection laws, obviate the need for conduct rules by achieving
                        comparable benefits at lower cost. Second, the record does not identify any legal authority
                        to adopt conduct rules for all ISPs, and we decline to distort the market with a patchwork
                        of non-uniform, limited-purpose rules. Third, scrutinizing closely each prior conduct rule,
                        we find that the costs of each rule outweigh its benefits.

                    <p class="s3" style="display: inline;">
                        We also eliminate the position of Open Internet Ombudsperson, the formal complaint process,
                        and the issuance of advisory opinions, because the work of the Open Internet Ombudsperson is
                        more appropriately handled by Commission staff, and because the issuance of advisory
                        opinions and the formal complaint process have not been shown to provide any benefit to
                        broadband Internet access service providers or consumers.

                        existed prior to the <em>Title II Order</em>. This will remove regulatory burdens from
                        providers of mobile broadband Internet access service, including small providers.
