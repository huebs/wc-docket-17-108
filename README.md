WC Docket No. 17-108
====================

Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order, and Order
-----------------------------------------------

I found the [PDF](http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf) provided by the
FCC to be extremely hard to work with (particularly when trying to select text for highlighting or copying.  I used
[Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 2018](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat.html) to convert the document to a signle HTML
document (which I cleaned up) as well as RTF and Word documents using both the preserve the layout and flowing text
options.  I then saved the Word documents as PDFs.  The [Flowing Text PDF](flowing_text.pdf) works the best for
selecting text. The TOC is slightly corrupted but all the links works unlike the [Original PDF](original.pdf).
