That ended two years ago. In 2015, the Commission imposed heavy-handed, utility-style regulation on Internet service providers (ISPs). Since then, broadband investment has fallen for two years in a row\'97the first time that that\'92s happened outside a recession in the Internet era.

This will promote future innovation and investment. And more investment in digital infrastructure will create jobs, increase competition, and lead to better, faster, cheaper Internet access for all Americans, especially those in rural and low-income areas.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\sl240\slmult1\f0\fs22\b0\i0\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\sl240\slmult1\f1\fs22\b1{\ulth What the Declaratory Ruling Would Do}:\par\pard\plain\s4\ls2\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li1019\fi-359\ri334\sl240\slmult1\sb12\tx1020\tx1021\f0\fs22\b0 Restore the classification of broadband Internet access service as an \'93information service\'94\'97the classification affirmed by the Supreme Court in the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Brand X\expnd-2\expndtw-11  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 case.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls2\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li1019\fi-359\sl240\slmult1\sb17\tx1020\tx1021\f0\fs22\b0 Reinstate the private mobile service classification of mobile broadband Internet access\expnd-4\expndtw-19  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 service.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls2\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li1020\fi-360\ri395\sl240\slmult1\sb14\tx1020\tx1021\f0\fs22\b0 Clarify the effects of the return to an information service classification on other regulatory frameworks, including the need for a uniform federal regulatory approach to apply to interstate information services like broadband Internet access\expnd-3\expndtw-13  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 service.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\sl240\slmult1\sb1\f0\fs22\b0\i0\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li300\sl240\slmult1\sb1\f1\fs22\b1{\ulth What the Report and Order Would Do:}\par\pard\plain\s4\ls2\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li1020\fi-360\ri1056\sl240\slmult1\sb12\tx1020\tx1021\f0\fs22\b0 Adopt transparency requirements that ISPs disclose information about their practices to consumers, entrepreneurs, and the\expnd-1\expndtw-4  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 Commission.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls2\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li1020\fi-360\ri288\sl240\slmult1\sb16\tx1020\tx1021\f0\fs22\b0 Restore the Federal Trade Commission\'92s ability to protect consumers online from any unfair, deceptive, and anticompetitive practices without burdensome regulations, achieving comparable benefits at lower\expnd0\expndtw0  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 cost.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls2\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li1020\fi-360\ri1314\sl240\slmult1\sb13\tx1020\tx1021\f0\fs22\b0 Eliminate the vague and expansive Internet Conduct Standard, under which the FCC micromanaged innovative business models, along with the bright-line\expnd-3\expndtw-14  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 rules.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\sl240\slmult1\sb2\f0\fs22\b0\i0\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li300\sl240\slmult1\f1\fs22\b1{\ulth What the Order Would Do:}\par\pard\plain\s4\ls2\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li1020\fi-360\ri245\sl240\slmult1\sb15\tx1020\tx1021\f0\fs22\b0 Find that the public interest is not served by adding to the already-voluminous record in this proceeding additional materials, including confidential materials submitted in other\expnd-5\expndtw-27  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 proceedings.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\sl240\slmult1\f0\fs20\b0\i0\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\sl240\slmult1\f0\fs20\b0\i0\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\sl240\slmult1\f0\fs20\b0\i0\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\sl240\slmult1\f0\fs20\b0\i0\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\sl240\slmult1\f0\fs20\b0\i0\par

\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Today, we honor that bipartisan commitment to a free and open Internet by rejecting government control of the Internet. We reverse the Commission\'92s abrupt shift two years ago to heavy-handed utility-style regulation of broadband Internet access service and return to the light-touch framework under which a free and open Internet underwent rapid and unprecedented growth for almost two decades. We eliminate burdensome regulation that stifles innovation and deters investment, and empower Americans to choose the broadband Internet access service that best fits their needs.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls4\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi720\ri293\sl240\slmult1\sb115\tx1739\tx1741\f0\fs22\b0 We take several actions in this Order to restore Internet freedom. First, we end utility- style regulation of the Internet in favor of the market-based policies necessary to preserve the future of Internet freedom. In the 2015 \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order\f0\i0 , the Commission abandoned almost twenty years of precedent and reclassified broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service subject to myriad regulatory obligations under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the\expnd-4\expndtw-20  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 Act).{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark3" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 2}}

We find that reclassification as an information service best comports with the text and structure of the Act, Commission precedent, and our policy objectives. We thus return to the approach to broadband Internet access service affirmed as reasonable by the U.S. Supreme Court.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark4" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 3}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 We also reinstate the private mobile service classification of mobile broadband Internet access service and return to the Commission\'92s definition of \'93interconnected service\'94 that existed prior to 2015. We determine that this light-touch information service framework will promote investment and innovation better than applying costly and restrictive laws of a bygone era to broadband Internet access service. Our balanced approach also restores the authority of the nation\'92s most experienced cop on the privacy beat\'97the Federal Trade Commission\'97to police the privacy practices of Internet Service Providers (ISPs).\par\pard\plain\s4\ls4\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi720\ri219\sl240\slmult1\sb121\tx1739\tx1740\f0\fs22\b0 Next, we require ISPs to be transparent. Disclosure of network management practices, performance, and commercial terms of service is important for Internet freedom because it helps consumers choose what works best for them and enables entrepreneurs and other small businesses to get technical information needed to innovate. Individual consumers, not the government, decide what Internet access service best meets their individualized needs.

The record evidence, including our cost-benefit analysis, demonstrates that the costs of these rules to innovation and investment outweigh any benefits they may have. In addition, we have not identified any sources of legal authority that could justify the comprehensive conduct rules governing ISPs adopted in the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order. \f0\fs22\b0\i0 Lastly, we find that the conduct rules are unnecessary because the transparency requirement we adopt, together with antitrust and consumer protection laws, ensures that consumers have means to take remedial action if an ISP engages in behavior inconsistent with an open Internet.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls4\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi720\ri342\sl240\slmult1\sb120\tx1739\tx1740\f0\fs22\b0 Through these actions, we advance our critical work to promote broadband\expnd-5\expndtw-27  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 deployment in rural America and infrastructure investment throughout the nation, brighten the future of innovation both within networks and at their edge, and move closer to the goal of eliminating the digital\expnd-4\expndtw-19  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 divide.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls4\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li1019\fi-720\sl240\slmult1\sb120\tx1019\tx1020{\*\bkmkstart II.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Based on the record before us, we conclude that the best reading of the relevant definitional provisions of the Act supports classifying broadband Internet access as an information service. Having determined that broadband Internet access service, regardless of whether offered using fixed or mobile technologies, is an information service under the Act, we also conclude that as an information service, mobile broadband Internet access service should not be classified as a commercial mobile service or its functional equivalent. We find that it is well within our legal authority to classify broadband Internet access service as an information service, and reclassification also comports with applicable law governing agency decisions to change course. While we find our legal analysis sufficient on its own to support an information service classification of broadband Internet access service, strong public policy considerations further weigh in favor of an information service classification. Below, we find that economic theory, empirical data, and even anecdotal evidence also counsel against imposing public-utility style regulation on ISPs. The broader Internet ecosystem thrived under the light- touch regulatory treatment of Title I, with massive investment and innovation by both ISPs and edge providers, leading to previously unimagined technological developments and services.  We conclude that a return to Title I classification would facilitate critical broadband investment and innovation by removing regulatory uncertainty and lowering compliance\expnd-2\expndtw-12  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 costs.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls6\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li1740\fi-720\ri482\sl240\slmult1\sb119\tx1740\tx1741{\*\bkmkstart A.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Below, we first explore the meaning of the \'93capability\'94 contemplated in the statutory definition of \'93information service,\'94 and find that broadband Internet access service provides consumers the \'93capability\'94 to engage in all of the information processes listed in the information service definition. We also find that broadband Internet access service likewise provides information processing functionalities itself, such as DNS and caching, which satisfy the capabilities set forth in the information service definition. We then address what \'93capabilities\'94 we believe are being \'93offered\'94 by ISPs, and whether these are reasonably viewed as separate from or inextricably intertwined with transmission, and find that broadband Internet access service offerings inextricably intertwine these information processing capabilities with\expnd0\expndtw-1  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 transmission.\f0\fs22\cf1\par\pard\plain\s4\ls7\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi721\ri123\sl240\slmult1\sb120\tx1740\tx1741\f0\fs22\b0 We find that applying our understanding of the statutory definitions to broadband Internet access service as it is offered today most soundly leads to the conclusion that it is an information service. Although the Internet marketplace has continued to develop in the years since the earliest classification decisions, broadband Internet access service offerings still involve a number of \'93capabilities\'94 within the meaning of the Section 3 definition of information services, including critical capabilities that all ISP customers must use for the service to work as it does today.  While many popular uses of the Internet have shifted over time, the record reveals that broadband Internet access service continues to offer information service capabilities that typical users both expect and rely upon. Indeed, the basic nature of Internet service\'97\'93[p]rovid[ing] consumers with a comprehensive capability for manipulating information using the Internet via high-speed telecommunications\'94\'97has remained the same since the Supreme Court upheld the Commission\'92s similar classification of cable modem service as an information service twelve years ago.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark78" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 77}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Because broadband Internet access service was not directly addressed in pre-1996 Act \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Computer Inquiries \f0\fs22\b0\i0 and MFJ precedent, analogies to functions that were classified under that precedent must account for potentially distinguishing characteristics not only in terms of technical details but also in terms of the regulatory backdrop. The Communications Act enunciates a policy for the Internet that distinguishes broadband Internet access from legacy services like traditional telephone service.

Given the long history of common carriage offering of that service by the time of the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Computer Inquiries\f0\i0 , it is understandable that some precedent started with a presumption that the underlying service was a \'93basic service.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark139" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 138}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 But similar assumptions would not be warranted in the case of services other than traditional telephone service for which there was no similar longstanding history of common carriage.

We conclude that the best view of the text and structure of the Act undercuts arguments that Congress sought to preserve the substance of pre-1996 Act regulations through the definitions it adopted. Instead, where Congress sought to address substantive requirements akin to those in the MFJ and \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Computer Inquiries \f0\fs20\b0\i0 it did so by adopting subjective obligations in the 1996 Act\'97even if not identical to the pre- 1996 Act requirements\'97and subject to their own Congressionally-specified standards for when and to what entities they apply. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 See, e.g.\f0\i0 , 47 U.S.C. \'A7\'A7 251, 256. In addition, the wholesale service focus of substantive MFJ and \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Computer Inquiries \f0\fs20\b0\i0 common carrier transmission obligations also distinguishes them from the retail service we classify here, likewise undermining any claimed relevance of those pre-1996 Act transmission requirements to our classification decision. The Commission recognized, for example, that the transmission underlying broadband internet access required by the \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Computer Inquiries \f0\fs20\b0\i0 to be offered on an unbundled, common carrier basis and provided to ISPs was not a \'93retail\'94 service within the meaning of section 251(c)(4) resale requirements. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Deployment of Wireline Services Offering Advanced Telecommunications Capability\f0\i0 , CC Docket No. 98-147, Second Report and Order, 14 FCC Rcd 19237 (1999). Nor did such a common carrier transmission service itself enable access to the Internet, even if purchased by end-users. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 See, e.g.\f0\i0 , \f2\fs20\b0\i1 id\f0\i0 . at 19240, para. 6 & n.16 (noting a DSL transmission offering that, as explained in the associated marketing materials, end-users could purchase and use in conjunction with certain partner ISPs).  By comparison, under the \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Computer Inquiries\f0\i0 , the finished service offered to end-users relying on the required common carrier transmission as an input was regulated as an enhanced service, not a common carrier offering, even when offered by the facilities-based carrier\'92s subsidiary. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 See, e.g.\f0\i0 , \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Computer II Final Decision\f0\i0 , 77 FCC 2d at 474, para. 230 (when carriers\'92 enhanced services subsidiaries offer enhanced services \'93the subsidiary itself is not regulated\'94). Given our focus here on the finished retail broadband Internet access service, we see little relevance to prior regulatory requirements that were imposed to ensure competing providers had access to a wholesale input in the form of a compelled common carriage offering of bare transmission that did not itself provide Internet\expnd0\expndtw-1  \f0\fs20\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 access.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li300\sl240\slmult1\sb116{\*\bkmkstart _bookmark182}{\*\bkmkend _bookmark182}\f0\fs13\b0\up7 181 \f2\fs20\b0\i1\up0 Stevens Report\f0\i0 , 13 FCC Rcd at 11540, para. 81.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\ri149\qj\sl240\slmult1\sb114{\*\bkmkstart _bookmark183}{\*\bkmkend _bookmark183}\f0\fs13\b0\up7 182 \f2\fs20\b0\i1\up0 Brand X\f0\i0 , 545 U.S. at 998.

Although parties have, over time, held various views regarding the proper classification of broadband Internet access services, the mere fact that a party held such a view in the past, or holds such a view today, does not render a Commission decision confirming a particular view \'93moot,\'94 \f2\fs20\b0\i1 see, e.g.\f0\i0 , Free Press Reply at 14 (\'93AT&T\'92s new notion that DSL offered at retail was somehow an information service after the passage of the 1996 Act would render the 2005 \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Wireline Broadband Order \f0\fs20\b0\i0 moot\'94), since a private party\'92s subjective view is not authoritative. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Brand X\f0\i0 , 545 U.S. at 998.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li300\fi-1\ri127\sl240\slmult1\sb115{\*\bkmkstart _bookmark184}{\*\bkmkend _bookmark184}\f0\fs13\b0\up7 183 \f2\fs20\b0\i1\up0 Brand X\f0\i0 , 545 U.S. at 998.

Beginning with the earliest classification decisions, the Commission found that transmission provided by ISPs outside the last mile was part of an integrated information service.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark201" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 200}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Nor did any Justice in \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Brand X \f0\fs22\b0\i0 contest the view that, beyond the last mile, cable operators were offering an information service. Indeed, the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order\f0\i0 \'92s broad interpretation of \'93telecommunications service\'94 stands in contrast to the views of Justice Scalia himself,{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark203" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 202 }}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Justice Scalia was skeptical that a telecommunications service classification of cable modem service would lead to the classification of ISPs as telecommunications carriers based on the transmission underlying their \'93connect[ions] to other parts of the Internet, including Internet backbone providers.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark205" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 204}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Yet the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 reached essentially that outcome. The \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order\f0\i0 \'92s interpretation of the statutory definitions did not merely lead it to classify \'91last mile\'92 transmission as a telecommunications service. Rather, under the view of the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order\f0\i0 , even the transmissions underlying an ISP\'92s connections to other parts of the Internet, including Internet backbone providers was part of the classified telecommunications service.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark206" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 205}}

\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 On the contrary, we agree that \'93it is hardly \'91oblique\'92 for Congress to confirm in section 230 that Internet access should be classified as an unregulated information service when elsewhere in the same legislation Congress codifies a definition of \'91information services\'92 that was long understood to include gateway services such as Internet access.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark235" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 233}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 And while the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 US Telecom \f0\fs22\b0\i0 court did not find this definition determinative on the issue, we find that \'93it is nonetheless a strong indicator that Congress was more comfortable with the prevailing view that provision of Internet access is not a telecommunications service, and should not be subject to the array of Title II statutory provisions.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark236" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 234}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 We find inapplicable the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 USTelecom \f0\fs22\b0\i0 court\'92s invocation of the principle that \'93Congress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark237" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 235}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Section 230 did not alter any fundamental details of Congress\'92s regulatory scheme but was part and parcel of that scheme, and confirmed what follows from a plain reading of Title I\'97namely, that broadband Internet access service meets the definition of an information\expnd-1\expndtw-3  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 service.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark238" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 236}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 It is hard to imagine clearer statutory language.

\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 \'93Interconnected service,\'94 in turn, is defined as \'93service that is interconnected with the public switched network (as such terms are defined by regulation by the Commission).\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark255" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 253}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 In 1994, the Commission adopted regulations implementing this section, codifying the definition of \'93commercial mobile service\'94 under the term \'93commercial mobile radio service\'94 (CMRS).{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark256" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 254}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Looking at the statute\'92s text, structure, legislative history, and purpose, the Commission defined the \'93public switched network\'94 as \'93[a]ny common carrier switched network, whether by wire or radio, including local exchange carriers, interexchange carriers, and mobile service providers, that use[s] the North American Numbering Plan in connection with the provision of switched services.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark257" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 255}}

\fs14\up8   \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 In 1994, the  Commission established its functional equivalence test, which starts with a presumption that \'93a mobile service that does not meet the definition of CMRS is a private mobile radio service.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark260" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 258}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Overcoming this presumption requires an analysis of a variety of factors to determine whether the mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of mobile service, including \'93consumer demand for the service to determine whether the service is closely substitutable for a commercial mobile radio service; whether changes in price for the service under examination, or for the comparable commercial mobile radio service would prompt customers to change from one service to the other; and market research information identifying the targeted market for the service under review.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark261" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 259}}

It found that wireless broadband Internet access was not \'93interconnected\'94 with the \'93public switched network\'94 because it did not use the North American Numbering Plan, which limited \'93subscribers\'92 ability to communicate to or receive communication from all users in the public switched network.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark266" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 264}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 The Commission concluded that section 332 and the Commission\'92s rules \'93did not contemplate wireless broadband Internet access service as provided today\'94 and that a commercial mobile service \'93must still be interconnected with the local exchange or interexchange switched network as it\expnd-1\expndtw-6  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 evolves.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark267" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 265}}

First, the Commission changed definitions of two key terms within the definition of commercial mobile service.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark268" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 266}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 It broadened the definition of the term \'93public switched network\'94 to include services that use \'93public IP addresses.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark269" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 267}}
\fs14\up8 \up0  \f0\fs22\b0\i0 And it redefined the term \'93interconnected service\'94 by deleting the word \'93all\'94 from the requirement that the service give subscribers the capability to communicate with \'93\f2\i1 all \f0\fs22\b0\i0 other users on the public switched network,\'94 so that a service would be interconnected even if users of such a service could not communicate with all other users.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark270" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 268}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 By manipulating these definitions, the Commission engineered a conclusion that mobile broadband Internet access was interconnected with the public switched network and was an interconnected service under section\expnd-1\expndtw-7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 332.\f0\fs22\cf1\par\pard\plain\s4\ls7\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi720\ri351\sl240\slmult1\sb125\tx1739\tx1740\f0\fs22\b0 Second, the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 found that even if it had not changed the definitions, it could change the scope of the service to meet them. Specifically, the Commission found that \'93users have the \'91capability\'92 . . . to communicate with NANP numbers using their broadband connection through the use of VoIP applications.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark271" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 269 }}
\fs14\up8 \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Accordingly it found that, by including services not offered by the mobile broadband Internet access service provider as part of the service, mobile broadband Internet access service would now meet the regulatory definition of \'93interconnected service\'94 adopted in\expnd-4\expndtw-18  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 1994.\f0\fs22\cf1\par\pard\plain\s4\ls7\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li300\fi719\ri303\sl240\slmult1\sb114\tx1739\tx1741\f0\fs22\b0 Third, the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 eschewed the functional equivalence test contained in the Commission\'92s rules to find that mobile broadband Internet access service was functionally equivalent to commercial mobile service. Rather than apply that test, the Commission reasoned that the two were functionally equivalent because \'93like commercial mobile service, [mobile broadband Internet access service] is a widely available, for profit mobile service that offers mobile subscribers the capability to send and receive communications on their mobile device to and from the\expnd-2\expndtw-8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 public.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark272" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 270}}

\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 On multiple prior occasions before Section 332(d)(2) was enacted, the Commission used the term \'93public switched network\'94 to refer to the traditional public switched telephone network.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark277" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 275}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 In 1981, for example, the Commission noted that \'93the public switched network interconnects all telephones in the country.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark278" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 276}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 In 1992, the Commission described its cellular service policy as \'93encourag[ing] the creation of a nationwide, seamless system, interconnected with the public switched network so that cellular and landline telephone customers can communicate with each other on a universal basis.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark279" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 277}}

\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Based on this history of usage of the term, the Commission, in 1994, tied its definition of the term \'93public switched network\'94 to the traditional switched telephone network.

One commenter notes that the Budget Act conferees chose the Senate version of the relevant statutory definitions, including the use of the term \'93public switched network,\'94 over the House version, which used the term \'93public switched telephone network,\'94 and argues that Congress thereby rejected the latter term. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 See \f0\fs20\b0\i0 OTI New America Reply Comments at 65-66. We note, however, that the conferees also expressly identified the substantive differences between the House and Senate versions of the definitions, and notably absent from their list was any contrast between the Senate\'92s use of \'93public switched network\'94 and the House\'92s use of \'93public switched telephone\par\sect\sectd\sbkpage\headery730\footery910\margtsxn1340\margbsxn1100\pard\plain\s3\ls7\ilvl0\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi721\ri117\sl237\slmult1\sb124\tx1739\tx1741\f0\fs22\b0 We also find that the Commission\'92s prior interpretation is more consistent with the text of section 332(d)(2), in which Congress provided that commercial mobile service must provide a service that is interconnected with \'93\f2\i1 the \f0\fs22\b0\i0 public switched network.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark282" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 280}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 We find that the use of the definite article \'93the\'94 and singular term \'93network\'94 shows that Congress intended \'93public switched network\'94 to mean a single, integrated network. We therefore agree with commenters who argue that it was not meant to encompass multiple networks whose users cannot necessarily communicate or receive communications across networks.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark283" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 281}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Consistent with Congress\'92s directive to define \'93\f2\i1 the \f0\fs22\b0\i0 public switched network,\'94 the restored definition reflects that the public switched network is a singular network that \'93must still be interconnected with the local exchange or interexchange switched network as it evolves,\'94 as opposed to multiple networks that need not be connected to the public telephone network.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark284" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 282}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 That the Commission\'92s original interpretation better reflects Congressional intent is further evidenced by the fact that, although Congress has amended the Communications Act and Section 332 on multiple occasions since the Commission defined the term, it has never changed the Commission\'92s\expnd-1\expndtw-7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 interpretation.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark285" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 283}}

Prior to that Order, the term was defined under the Commission\'92s rules as a service \'93that gives subscribers the capability to communicate to or receive communication from \f2\fs22\b0\i1 all \f0\fs22\b0\i0 other users on the public switched network.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark286" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 284}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 The \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 modified this definition by deleting the word \'93all,\'94 finding that mobile broadband Internet access service should still be considered an interconnected service even if it only enabled users to communicate with \'93some\'94 other users of the public switched network rather than all.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark287" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 285}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 We agree with commenters who argue that the best reading of \'93interconnected service\'94 is one that enables communication between its users and all other users of the public switched network.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark288" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 286}}
\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 This reading ensures that the public switched network remains the single, integrated network that we find Congress intended in Section 332(d)(2), as reflected in the statutory definition of \'93interconnected service\'94 as one that is interconnected with \'93the public switched\expnd-3\expndtw-13  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 network.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark289" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 287}}

Thus, we are not persuaded by arguments that \'93applications such as Google Voice reflect the fully interconnected nature of the mobile broadband and legacy telephone networks.\'94 OTI New America Comments at 84. Our determination reflects that the relevant service must itself be an \'93interconnected service,\'94 and not merely a capability to acquire interconnection. We further note that viewing broadband Internet access service as a distinct service from application layer services that may be accessed by it, even if the applications are pre-installed in the mobile device offered by the provider, ensures that similar mobile broadband Internet access services are not regulated in a disparate fashion based on what applications a particular provider chooses to install in their offered devices. This is consistent with the fundamental purpose under section 332 of regulatory symmetry between similar mobile services, and also avoids regulatory inconsistencies that would result when mobile devices are brought to a particular service provider by the consumer that do not include the provider\'92s choice of pre-installed apps. While OTI New America argues that the need to obtain such apps to make an interconnected call does not make mobile broadband Internet access service different from traditional telephone service, which has always required customer premises equipment to complete an interconnected call, \f2\fs20\b0\i1 see \f0\fs20\b0\i0 OTI New America Reply at 56, we find the analogy inapt. With traditional CMRS, even where consumers obtain their premises equipment or mobile devices separately, the function of interconnection is provided by the purchased mobile service itself.\par\sect\sectd\sbkpage\headery730\footery679\margtsxn1340\margbsxn940\pard\plain\s3\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\ri138\sl237\slmult1\sb119\f0\fs22\b0 them to send calls and texts to NANP end-points\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark300" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 298 }}

Under this test, a variety of factors will be evaluated to make a determination whether the mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a commercial mobile radio service, including: consumer demand for the service to determine whether the service is closely substitutable for a commercial mobile radio service; whether changes in price for the service under examination, or for the comparable commercial mobile radio service would prompt customers to change from one service to the other; and market research information identifying the targeted market for the service under review.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark311" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 308}}

\fs14\up8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 We note again that, under this test, services not meeting the definition of commercial mobile service are presumed to be not functionally equivalent, a presumption particularly intuitive here in light of the functional differences between traditional commercial mobile services like mobile voice and today\'92s mobile broadband services. The evidence on demand substitutability only reinforces this presumption. First, mobile broadband Internet access service and traditional mobile voice services have different service characteristics and intended use. Consumers purchase mobile broadband Internet access service to access the Internet, on-line video, games, search engines, websites, and various other applications, while they purchase mobile voice service solely to make calls to other users using NANP numbers. Pricing and marketing information similarly support the conclusion that today mobile broadband Internet access service and traditional mobile voice services are not \'93closely substitutable.\'94 Such evidence suggests, for example, that mobile service providers target different types of customer groups when advertising voice, as opposed to mobile broadband Internet access service.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark318" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 315}}

We find the Title II classification likely has resulted, and will result, in considerable social cost, in terms of foregone investment and innovation. At the same time, classification of broadband Internet access service under Title II has had no discernable incremental benefit relative to Title I classification.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark333" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 329}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 The regulations promulgated under the Title II regime appear to have been a solution in search of a problem. Close examination of the examples of harm cited by proponents of Title II to justify heavy-handed regulation reveal that they are sparse and often exaggerated. Moreover, economic incentives, including competitive pressures, support Internet openness. We find that the gatekeeper theory, the bedrock of the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order\f0\i0 \'92s overall argument justifying its approach, is a poor fit for the broadband Internet access service market. Further, even if there may be potential harms, we find that pre-existing legal remedies, particularly antitrust and consumer protection laws, sufficiently address such harms so that they are outweighed by the well-recognized disadvantages of public utility regulation.  As such, we find that public policy considerations support our legal finding that broadband Internet access service is an information service under the\expnd-1\expndtw-6  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 Act.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls9\ilvl2\nooverflow\nocwrap\li2459\fi-720\sl240\slmult1\sb118\tx2459\tx2460{\*\bkmkstart 1.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 This concern is well-documented in the economics literature on regulatory theory, and the record also supports the theory that the regulation imposed by Title II will negatively impact investment. The balance of the evidence in the record suggests that Title II classification has reduced ISP investment in the network, as well as hampered innovation, because of regulatory uncertainty.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 The mechanisms by which public utility regulation can depress investment by the regulated entity are well- known in the regulatory economics literature. The owners of network infrastructure make long-term, irreversible investments. In theory, public utility regulation is intended to curb monopoly pricing just enough that the firm earns a rate of return on its investments equivalent to what it would earn in a competitive market. In practice, public utility regulation can depress profits below the competitive rate of return for a variety of reasons. This reduction in the expected return reduces the incentive to invest.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark337" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 332}}

Accordingly, the findings may be a more reliable indicator of the direction of the change in investment than the absolute size of the change. At the very least, the study suggests that news of impending Title II regulation is associated with a reduction in ISP investment over a multi-year period.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls9\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi721\ri165\sl240\slmult1\sb121\tx1739\tx1741\f0\fs22\b0 Some commenters have argued that this study does not identify the effect of Title II on ISP investment, because the \'91last mile\'92 facilities and transmission underlying DSL Internet access service (essentially incumbent LEC broadband supply) was under Title II before 2005, during the study\'92s pre- treatment period.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark362" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 355}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 While we appreciate the alternative method and data sources introduced by that study, several elements lead us to discount its findings.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 In addition, when examining cable and telecommunications infrastructure investment in the U.S., the study relies on a regression discontinuity over time model, thereby eliminating the use of a separate control group to identify the effect of policy changes.

The evidence that Title II has depressed broadband investment is bolstered by other record evidence showing that Title II stifled network innovation. Among the unseen social costs of regulation are those broadband innovations and developments that never see the light of day. ISP investment does not simply take the form of greater deployment, but can also be directed toward new and more advanced services for consumers. Research and development is an inherently risky part \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd-1\expndtw-3 of \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 any business, and the Commission\'92s actions should not introduce greater uncertainty and risk into the process without a clear need to do so. Numerous commenters have stated that the uncertainty regarding what is allowed and what is not allowed under the new Title II broadband regime has caused them to shelve projects that were in development, pursue fewer innovative business models and arrangements, or delay rolling out new features or services. Even large ISPs with significant resources have not been immune to the dampening effect that uncertainty can have on a firm\'92s incentive to innovate. Charter, for instance, has asserted that it has \'93put on hold a project to build out its out-of-home Wi-Fi network, due in part to concerns about whether future interpretations of Title II would allow Charter to continue to offer its Wi-Fi network as a benefit to its existing subscribers.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark370" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 362}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 With future regulations open to such uncertainties, Title II regulation adds a risk premium on each investment decision, which reduces the expected profitability of potential investments and deters investment.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark379" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 371}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 For example, the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 did not forbear from \f2\fs22\b0\i1 ex post \f0\fs22\b0\i0 enforcement actions related to subscriber charges, raising concerns that \f2\fs22\b0\i1 ex post \f0\fs22\b0\i0 price regulation was very much a possibility.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark380" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 372}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 These concerns were compounded by the fact that while the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 itself announced forbearance from \f2\fs22\b0\i1 ex ante \f0\fs22\b0\i0 price regulation, at the same time it imposed price regulation with its ban on paid\expnd-4\expndtw-19  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 prioritization\par

ISPs, as well as edge providers, are important drivers of the virtuous cycle, and regulation must be evaluated accounting for its impacts on ISPs\'92 capacity to drive that cycle, as well as that of edge providers. The underlying economic model of the virtuous cycle is that of a two-sided market. In a two-sided market, intermediaries\'97ISPs in our case\'97act as platforms facilitating interactions between two different customer groups, or sides of the market\'97edge providers and end users. The \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Open Internet Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 takes the position that edge provider innovation drives consumer adoption of Internet access and platform upgrades. The key characteristic of a two-sided market, however, is that participants on each side of the market value a platform service more as the number and/or quality of participants on the platform\'92s other side increases. (The benefits subscribers on one side of the market bring to the subscribers on the other, and \f2\fs22\b0\i1 vice versa\f0\i0 , are called positive externalities.){\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark456" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 440}}
\fs13\up7   \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Thus, rather than a single side driving the market,  both sides generate network externalities, and the platform provider profits by inducing both sides of the market to use its platform. In maximizing profit, a platform provider sets prices and invests in network extension and innovation to maximize the gain subscribers (and potential subscribers) on both sides of the market obtain in interacting across the platform, subject to costs and competitive conditions.

In a two-sided market, three potential reasons for Title II regulation arise: the extent to which ISPs have market power in selling Internet access to end users; the extent to which ISPs have market power in selling to edge providers access to the ISP\'92s subscribers (end users), which seems to primarily be what the Commission and others appear to be referring when using the term \'93gatekeeper\'94; and the extent to which the positive externalities present in a two-sided market might lead to market failure even in the absence (or because of that absence) of ISP market power.

This is because acting badly in uncompetitive areas may be operationally expensive (i.e., requiring different equipment, different policies, different worker training, and different call centers to address differing circumstances) and reputationally expensive (e.g., even if behavior is confined to an uncompetitive market, customers in competitive markets may churn after learning about such behavior). Accordingly (and unsurprisingly), most ISPs actively try to minimize the discrepancies in their terms of service, network management practices, billing systems, and other policies\'97even if they offer different service tiers or pricing in different areas. Approximately 79 percent of US households are found in census blocks that at least two wireline ISPs report serving, and approximately another 7 percent of households are in census blocks where the unique wireline ISP providing service in the census block faces competition from a rival in 90 percent of the blocks it services.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark478" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 461}}

A terminating (access) monopoly arises when customers on one side of the market, roughly speaking end users in our case, single home with little prospect of switching to another platform in the short run, while customers on the other side, roughly speaking edge providers in our case, find it worthwhile to multi-home. The terminating monopoly differs from conventional market power because it can arise despite effective competition between platforms. In that case, platforms must vigorously compete for single-homing end users, but have less need to compete for edge providers, who subscribe to all platforms.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark502" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 485}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 While such an outcome generally will not be efficient, there is no general presumption about the extent of that inefficiency, or even if prices to the multi-homers ideally should be lower than would emerge in the absence of a termination monopoly.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark505" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 488}}

Specifically, carriers must interconnect with each other and originating carriers must pay terminating carriers rates set by the terminating carrier in their tariff (with some government oversight). That leads to a \'93bargaining\'94 situation where one party sets the terms of the deal and the other must accept it or complain to the regulator\'97in other words, the regulations prohibit a normal free market from developing. Such regulatory requirements do not exist in broadband. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 See \f0\fs20\b0\i0 AT&T Comments at 32-33 & n.62 (\'93As the Commission ultimately acknowledged, however, this \'93[]LEC access charge\'94 problem arose not from a market failure, but from the application of Title II regulation itself\'97specifically, from tariffing, interconnection, and geographic-averaging requirements. . . . The broadband market contains no such regulatory distortions and presents no \'93terminating access monopoly.\'94 \f2\fs20\b0\i1 . . . \f0\fs20\b0\i0 No broadband ISP can \'93tariff\'94 the \'93service\'94 of providing access to its end users, and no backbone or other third-party network has any regulatory obligation to interconnect with any ISP, let alone pay whatever rates the ISP might wish to charge for access to its users.\'94); AT&T Economic Declaration at 35 (\'93\'93terminating access\'94 problems are not market failures to be ameliorated by regulatory intervention, but are actually market distortions \f2\fs20\b0\i1 created by \f0\fs20\b0\i0 regulation, most notably in the context of landline voice long-distance services. In that context, [IXCs] required access to [LEC] networks to terminate calls. LECs could charge high fees for that access and the IXCs were required to pay those fees. The IXCs could not charge their own customers different fees based on the LEC fees, and the LEC customers had no direct relationship with the IXCs. Because the end users did not have to bear the higher costs, they had no reason to switch to an alternative terminating access provider, which arguably gave their local provider market power in the provision of terminating access service. In contrast, if an Internet Service Provider attempted to block or throttle specific content, its end user customers would be directly affected by, and could directly observe, that behavior, and they would have the incentive and ability to react to that conduct.  The same is true if an Internet Service Provider attempted to impose discriminatory charges on particular content\expnd0\expndtw-1  \f0\fs20\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 providers[].\'94).\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\ri156\sl240\slmult1\sb121\f0\fs20\b0 Furthermore, two additional aspects unique to the traditional telephone market created those problems: (1) Voice call originators, who are (with the exception of reverse charge calls) the analogue to edge providers in voice- telecommunications, do not directly negotiate with the carrier that sets call termination charges, but rather only have a relationship with the call originating carrier. However, the originating carrier gains from high call termination charges when it terminates calls on its own network, so faces a conflict of interest when negotiating call termination charges on behalf of its subscribers. In fact, such a regime provides carriers with a mechanism for using the input price of call termination to collude on retail prices. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 See, e.g.\f0\i0 , M. Carter and J. Wright, \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Interconnection in Network Industries\f0\i0 , Rev. of Industrial Economics, 1999 14 (1) 1-25; J.S. Gans and S.P. King, \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Using \'91bill and keep\'92 interconnect Arrangements to Soften Network Competition\f0\i0 , Economic Letters 71 (3) 2001, 413-420; J-J. Laffont, P. Rey and J. Tirole, \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Network Competition: I. Overview and Nondiscriminatory Pricing\f0\i0 , The RAND Journal of Economics, 29 (1) 1998, 1-37; Verizon Economic Declaration at 33\'9634. In contrast, edge providers can directly connect with an ISP to reach that ISP\'92s end users, without seeking the ISP\'92s help to terminate on another ISP\'92s network (unlike in voice telecommunications), or can use intermediaries such as Cogent and Akamai, who largely do not terminate traffic to their own end users, so do not face the conflict that voice carriers face when negotiating termination charges. (2) Even if call originating carriers had good incentives to negotiate reasonable termination charges, regulation that requires interconnection, but does not appropriately regulate termination charges, seriously weakens their ability to obtain reasonable rates. Threatening to not interconnect is not an available negotiating ploy in telecommunications, but is one available to edge providers, especially larger ones, in negotiating with ISPs.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\ri412\qj\sl240\slmult1\sb2\f0\fs20\b0 Moreover, historically voice telephony consisted of geographic monopolies, making it pointless for one carrier to threaten another with disconnection since the end users of the disconnected carrier could not switch to a different carrier. Again, this is not true for Internet access.\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\ri253\sl240\slmult1\sb114{\*\bkmkstart _bookmark507}{\*\bkmkend _bookmark507}\f0\fs13\b0\up7 490 \f2\fs20\b0\i1\up0 See, e.g.\f0\i0 , Lauren Comment (\'93The internet is a general purpose technology (examples of GPTs are the wheel and electricity).

We thus conclude that our preemption determination is not contrary to section 414 of the Act, which states that \'93[n]othing in [the Act] shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute.\'94 47 U.S.C. \'A7 414; \f2\fs20\b0\i1 see, e.g.\f0\i0 , Public Knowledge Reply at 27.

\fs13\up7 \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Weighing the additional costs to ISPs against the limited incremental benefits to consumers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses, we conclude that the net benefits of these additional reporting obligations are likely negative.

Further, the requirements are critical to ensuring that consumers have sufficient information to make informed choices in their selection of ISPs and to deter ISPs from secretly erecting barriers to market entry by entrepreneurs and other small businesses.

And given the sheer number of ISPs offering service throughout the country\'974,559 at last count\'97we believe the most effective way to monitor for any such barriers is to require the public disclosure of an ISP\'92s practices so that Commission staff can review them while letting consumers, entrepreneurs, and other small businesses report to the Commission any market-barriers they discover.

Consistent with Commission precedent, we expect that ISPs will make disclosures in a manner accessible by people with disabilities.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark830" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 806}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 ISPs doing so need not distribute hard copy versions of the required disclosures and need not file them with the Commission, which can review the disclosures as needed on the ISPs\'92 websites.

For example, if ISPs do not disclose key details of how they provide broadband Internet access service, that could leave entrepreneurs and small businesses participating in the Internet marketplace unable to determine how well particular existing or contemplated offerings are likely to perform for users, and thus unable to determine if their service will be usable to a sufficient number of potential customers to make the offering viable. Such undisclosed practices also can leave consumers unable to judge which broadband Internet access service offerings will best meet their needs given the applications and service they wish to use. As a result, even if a sufficient number of consumers theoretically are accessible by a broadband Internet access service offering with sufficient technical characteristics to make a given Internet application or service viable, an entrepreneur\'92s or small business\'92s entry into the market for that service could be undermined if consumers are unable to identify which of the various broadband Internet access services offerings has the required technical characteristics. By contrast, the record reveals that the disclosure of practices and service characteristics we require today helps entrepreneurs and small businesses understand how well particular Internet application or service offerings are likely to work with particular ISPs\'92 broadband Internet access services and helps consumers make the most educated choice among ISPs and particular broadband Internet access service offerings, especially if they have particular interests in using Internet applications or services that are highly dependent on broadband Internet access service performance.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark846" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 821}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Broadband Internet access service subscribers will be able to use the disclosed information to evaluate broadband Internet access service offerings and determine which offering will best enable the use of the applications and service they desire. This helps guard against the potential barrier to entry and deterrent to technological advancement that otherwise could be faced by entrepreneurs\'92 and small business\'92 innovative Internet applications and service offerings, which may be dependent on the technical characteristics of broadband Internet access service. The information disclosed by ISPs also is relevant to Internet application and service providers\'92 purchase of services from those ISPs. The record reveals evidence that a number of the Internet applications and services that might be particularly sensitive to the manner in which an ISP provides broadband Internet access service potentially could benefit from the freedom this order provides for providers of such services and ISPs to enter prioritization arrangements to better ensure the performance of those Internet applications and services.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark868" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 842}}
\fs13\up7   \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Thus, the disclosures enable entrepreneurs, small businesses, and other participants in the Internet marketplace to evaluate how well their offerings will perform by default relative to the prioritization services that ISPs offer them. Enabling Internet application and service providers to evaluate their options in this way helps reduce barriers to entry that otherwise could exist and encourages entrepreneurs\'92 and small businesses\'92 ability to compete and develop and advance innovating offerings in furtherance of our statutory objectives. In addition to those considerations, as the Commission has recognized, disclosures help ensure accountability by ISPs and the potential for quick remedies if problematic practices occur.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark869" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 843}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 The disclosures also provide the Commission the information it needs for the evaluation required by section 257 of the Act, enabling us to spur regulatory action or seek legislative changes as needed. The transparency rule we retain thus directly advances the substantial government interests identified in section 257, section 218, and Title III of the Act.\f0\fs22\cf1\par\pard\plain\s4\ls16\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi721\ri164\sl240\slmult1\sb121\tx1739\tx1741\f0\fs22\b0 The transparency requirements also are no more extensive than necessary. The disclosures covered by our transparency rule are tied to our duties under section 257, section 218, and Title III of the Communications Act. We also observe in this regard that the most significant concerns were raised with respect to the additional reporting obligations adopted in the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 and here we eliminate those requirements in favor of a rule consistent in scope with the 2010 transparency rule.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark870" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 844}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Since the Commission adopted a transparency rule in the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Open Internet Order\f0\i0 , conduct requirements have varied substantially, from the rules adopted in the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Open Internet Order\f0\i0 , to no conduct rules after the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Verizon \f0\fs22\b0\i0 court case, to the rules adopted in the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order\f0\i0 . Yet through all that time, the Commission released only one Notice of Apparent Liability, against AT&T for allegedly violating the transparency rule.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark881" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 855}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 The dearth of actions enforcing conduct rules is striking. Further, the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 and \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Open Internet Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 do not, and could not, claim an epidemic or even uptick of blocking or degradation of traffic in the wake of the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Comcast \f0\fs22\b0\i0 or \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Verizon \f0\fs22\b0\i0 court decisions vacating the Commission\'92s prior attempts at openness regulation.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark882" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 856}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 These time periods provide a natural experiment disproving the notion that conduct rules are necessary to promote\expnd-2\expndtw-8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 openness.\f0\fs22\cf1\par\pard\plain\s4\ls16\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi720\ri120\sl240\slmult1\sb119\tx1739\tx1740\f0\fs22\b0 Although we think transparency promotes openness and empowers consumers, we recognize that regulation has an important role to play as a backstop where genuine harm is possible. In particular, transparency amplifies the power of antitrust law and the FTC Act to deter and where needed remedy behavior that harms consumers.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 The reasons for this are straightforward.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Without paid prioritization, ISPs must recover these costs solely from end users, but ISPs cannot always set prices targeted at the relevant end users. The resulting prices create inefficiencies. Consumers who do not cause these costs must pay for them, and end users who do cause these costs to some degree free-ride, inefficiently distorting usage of both groups. When paid prioritization signals to edge providers the costs their content or applications cause, edge providers can undertake actions that would improve the efficiency of the two-sided market. For example, they could invest in compression technologies if those come at a lower cost than paid prioritization, enhancing efficiency, or, if they have a pricing relationship with their end users, they could directly charge the end user for priority, leading those end users to adjust their usage if the user\'92s value does not exceed the service\'92s cost, again enhancing economic efficiency.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark939" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 909}}

According to the authors, paid prioritization causes the ISP to invest more in network capacity, reducing congestion and thereby inducing congestion-sensitive edge providers to enter the market. The increased ISP investment occurs for two reasons: incremental investment is more profitable because the ISP can now charge edge providers in addition to subscribers, and paid prioritization allows more edge providers who need a high quality of service to enter the market. Another study also develops a theoretical model in which paid prioritization always results in higher ISP investment.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark944" }}{\fldrslt \fs14\up8 914}}

For harms from exercising legally-acquired market power to arise, the ISP must have market power over the edge provider. However, as shown above, ISPs usually face at least moderate competition, and all the more so taking a medium-term perspective. Consequently, the harms that could possibly occur from exercise of such power are not likely to be large. Further, the extent to which any harms actually occur will be muted by two factors. First, ISPs have strong incentives to keep edge provider output high (as this increases the value end users see in subscribing to the ISP, and signals to edge providers that the ISP recognizes their contribution to the platform).{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark970" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 938}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Thus, harm will only occur to the extent the ISP is unable to devise pricing schemes that preserve edge providers\'92 incentives to bring content while maximizing the ISP\'92s profit (the exercise of market power is only harmful when it excludes what would otherwise be efficient purchases of access). Second, as discussed above, increased prices from edge providers are to a potentially significant extent passed through to end users in the form of lower prices for broadband Internet access service, with the result that end user demand for edge provider content is increased. The extent of such pass-through offsets these harms.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark971" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 939}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Accordingly, we expect the harms from dictating pricing uniformity to edge providers exceed any harms that may emerge from a lack of such\expnd-2\expndtw-12  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 regulation.\f0\fs22\cf1\par\pard\plain\s4\ls18\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li3180\fi-720\sl240\slmult1\sb119\tx3180\tx3181{\*\bkmkstart c.

As discussed above, the transparency rule we adopt, combined with antitrust and consumer protection laws, obviate the need for conduct rules by achieving comparable benefits at lower cost.

The direction in section 706(b) of the 1996 Act that the Commission exercise other authority by taking \'93immediate action\'94 in the event of a negative finding under the section 706(b) inquiry could, for example, form part of the basis for petition(s) for Commission rulemaking based on such other authority in the wake of a negative finding in the section 706(b) inquiry. Although the Tenth Circuit concluded that the possibility of such an interpretation of section 706(b) would not unambiguously compel the conclusion that the provision is hortatory, the court\'92s decision does not limit our ability to rely on that as a factor that persuades us that section 706(b) is better read as hortatory. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 See In re FCC 11-161\f0\i0 , 753 F.3d 1015, 1053-54 (10th Cir. 2014).\par\pard\plain\s1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li300\sl240\slmult1\sb114{\*\bkmkstart _bookmark1006}{\*\bkmkend _bookmark1006}\f0\fs13\b0\up7 972 \f2\fs20\b0\i1\up0 See, e.g.\f0\i0 , \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Ass\'92n of Civilian Tech. v.

Section 706(a) and (b) direct the Commission to promote competition in the local telecommunications market and otherwise encourage the deployment of advanced telecommunications capability.

Conversely, if the fact that a matter is addressed by the Communications Act were a more serious constraint on claimed section 706(a) and (b) authority, it is unclear how meaningful such claimed authority would be in practice. It thus likewise would be unclear what affirmative reason we would have for interpreting them as grants of authority contrary to the other indicia that they are hortatory.

If that precluded reliance on section 706(a) and (b) to impose analogous restrictions unbounded by the self-described scope of sections 201(b) and 202(a), the Commission seemingly would be left with no authority to adopt conduct rules of the sort at issue here after reclassification. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 See Title II Order\f0\i0 , 30 FCC Rcd at 5724-25, paras. 283-84 (finding that conduct rules for broadband Internet access service when classified as a telecommunications service were justified as an implementation of sections 201 and 202 of the Act).

We are unpersuaded by the suggestion that allowing ISPs to enter paid prioritization arrangements, even if subject to a commercial reasonableness standard, would trigger First Amendment scrutiny as a restriction on entities wishing to transmit speech on the Internet. \f2\fs20\b0\i1 See, e.g.\f0\i0 , Catherine Sandoval Aug. 30, 2017 \f2\fs20\b0\i1 Ex Parte \f0\fs20\b0\i0 Letter, Exh.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 In addition, section 230(b)(2) identifies Congress\'92 deregulatory policy for the Internet, explaining that \'93[i]t is the policy of the United States . . . to preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State regulation.\'94{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1086" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1049}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 This policy is reinforced by the deregulatory objectives of the 1996 Act more generally.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1087" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1050}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Against that policy backdrop, had Congress wanted us to regulate ISPs\'92 conduct we find it most likely that they would have spoken to that directly. Thus, the fact that the Commission would be left here to comb through myriad provisions of the Act in an effort to cobble together authority for ISP conduct rules itself leaves us dubious such rules really are within the authority granted by Congress.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls20\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li300\fi720\ri198\sl240\slmult1\sb121\tx1740\tx1741\f0\fs22\b0 In addition, the absence of demonstrated statutory authority that could support comprehensive conduct rules would leave us with, at most, a patchwork of non-uniform rules that would have problematic consequences and doubtful value. Virtually all of the remaining sources of possible authority identified in the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Open Internet Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 or the record here would encompass only discrete subsets of ISPs, such as ISPs that otherwise are providing common carrier voice services; ISPs that otherwise are cable operators or MVPDs; or ISPs that hold wireless licenses, among others. Individually, each of these sources of authority would leave substantial segments of ISPs unaddressed by any conduct rules. In addition, most of the remaining sources of authority would, at most, enable the Commission to target narrow types of behaviors, including, among other examples, actions by ISPs that otherwise offer common carrier voice services to interfere with competing over-the-top voice services or actions by certain ISPs that otherwise are video providers that harm the distribution of satellite programming. Importantly, substantial questions also remain on the record here about the merits of most of those theories of legal authority. For example, most if not all wired ISPs would appear to fall outside the scope of any sound basis of authority for conduct rules addressing the theories of harm identified in the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Open Internet\f0\i0 .

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 For the reasons discussed below, we remove these enforcement mechanisms.

Since the existing rules became effective in June 2015, the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau has engaged in an ongoing review of informal consumer complaints submitted to the Ombudsperson and to the Commission\'92s Consumer Complaint Center.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1101" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1063}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Many complaints convey frustration or dissatisfaction with a person or entity or discuss a subject without actually alleging wrongdoing on which the Commission may act; others represent isolated incidents that do not form a trend that allow judicious use of our limited resources. Staff from the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau review all informal open Internet complaints received by the Commission, and work with staff in the Enforcement Bureau who also monitor media reports and conduct additional research to identify complaint trends so the Commission can best target its enforcement capabilities toward entities that have a pattern of violating the Communications Act and the Commission\'92s rules, regulations, and orders. The Commission\'92s decision not to expend its limited resources investigating each complaint that consumers believe may be related to the open Internet rules does not mean that the Commission \'93has not taken the time to analyze these materials\'94 as alleged by some parties in the record.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1102" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1064}}

Our decision to eliminate the Open Internet Ombudsperson does not impact the existing review of trends or existing responses to consumer complaints by the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau and the Enforcement Bureau. Instead, it reduces confusion by making clear that staff specifically trained to work with consumers, known as Consumer Advocacy and Mediation Specialists (CAMS), are best suited to help consumers by providing them with understandable information about the issue they might be experiencing and to help file a complaint against a service provider if the consumer believes the service provider is violating our rules.

This approach allows us practically to evaluate the rules in a way that incorporates the decisions on classification and transparency that we have come to in this\expnd-1\expndtw-4  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 Order.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls20\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi720\ri125\sl240\slmult1\sb121\tx1739\tx1740\f2\fs22\b0\i1 Maintaining Title II Classification of Broadband Internet Access Service. \f0\fs22\b0\i0 We \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd-1\expndtw-3 have \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 found that the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 decreased investment and is likely to continue to decrease investment by ISPs.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1120" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1081}}
\fs13\up7 \up0  \f0\fs22\b0\i0 These decreases in investments are likely to result in less deployment of service to unserved areas and less upgrading of facilities in already served areas. For consumers, this means some will likely not have access to high-speed services over fixed or mobile networks and some will not experience better service as quickly as they otherwise would under a Title I classification. While the evidence in the record on the effect of Title II is varied in terms of details due to different methodologies, data, etc., we found that the Title II classification did directionally decrease investment by\expnd-3\expndtw-13  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 ISPs.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1121" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1082}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Ideally, we would estimate consumers\'92 and businesses\'92 valuations of the service or service improvements foregone caused by Title II classification. Unfortunately, the record before us does not allow for such estimation. We can reasonably conclude, however, that providers expect to recoup their investments over time through revenues generated by employing the networks resulting from the investment. Since these revenues come from consumers and businesses who are willing to pay \f2\fs22\b0\i1 at least \f0\fs22\b0\i0 their value of the service, the investment foregone due to Title II is a lower bound on the costs of maintaining the classification. This is a conservative estimate of the social welfare impact because frequently (1) a customer\'92s willingness to pay exceeds what the customer actually pays, and (2) the provider may make an economic profit.  These likelihoods both would increase the private costs associated with foregone investment due to maintaining Title II classification.  We therefore conclude that the private costs of maintaining a Title II classification due to foregone networks are directionally negative and likely constitute at least several billion dollars annually based on the\expnd-2\expndtw-8  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 record.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls20\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li300\fi719\ri193\sl240\slmult1\sb119\tx1739\tx1740\f0\fs22\b0 The Commission also asked in the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Internet Freedom NPRM \f0\fs22\b0\i0 about additional costs that could result from foregone network investments.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1123" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1084 }}
\fs13\up7 \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 When regulation discourages investment in the network, society is likely to lose some spillover benefits that the purchasers of broadband access do not themselves capture.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Given our decision to classify under Title I, the benefits of a transparency rule are expected to be of considerable magnitude since it is a key element of our approach of relying on enforcement under antitrust and consumer protection law to prevent and remedy harmful behaviors by ISPs. Numerous commenters indicate the benefits of a free and open Internet are large, so to the extent a transparency rule under our Title I approach is important for maintaining a free and open Internet, we can conclude the benefits are positive and considerable. Furthermore, transparency can provide other benefits in terms of consumer welfare. Namely, if transparency helps mitigate economic deadweight loss due to information asymmetry or if it helps consumers better satisfy their preferences in their purchasing decisions, then additional benefits will accrue. We therefore conclude that our transparency approach, as well as the transparency approaches in the 2010 \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Open Internet Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 and the 2015 \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order, \f0\fs22\b0\i0 all have positive\expnd-3\expndtw-14  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 benefits.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls20\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi720\ri205\sl240\slmult1\sb117\tx1739\tx1740\f0\fs22\b0 The costs of the transparency rules may vary given differences in their implementation. Comparing the transparency approach in the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Open Internet Order \f0\fs22\b0\i0 and the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order\f0\i0 , we conclude the costs were greater for the latter.

In this benefit-cost analysis, we consider the incremental benefit of the ban on paid prioritization relative to the regulatory environment created by this Order. The regulatory environment created by this Order will have antitrust and consumer protection enforcement in place. So we must ask what the ban on paid prioritization provides in additional benefits when compared to that baseline. We concluded that transparency combined with antitrust and consumer enforcement at the FTC will be able to address the vast majority of harms the ban on paid prioritization is intended to prevent. To the extent there are harms not well addressed by this enforcement, we would expect those cases to be infrequent and involve relatively small amounts of harm, though the record does not allow us to estimate this magnitude.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1142" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1095}}

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 However, we also recognize that these rules may create some compliance costs nonetheless.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 The Commission has broad discretion in how to manage its own proceedings,{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1156" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1109 }}
\fs13\up7 \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 and we find several problems with requiring the materials INCOMPAS seeks to be submitted into this rulemaking docket.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls20\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi720\ri237\sl240\slmult1\sb120\tx1739\tx1740\f0\fs22\b0 First, much of the material INCOMPAS seeks is now several years old and INCOMPAS has offered little demonstration of its relevance to this proceeding.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Also, as the opponents argue, many of the confidential materials cited by the Commission in its prior transaction decisions were cited as part of a larger group of mostly publicly available information.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1158" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1111}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Having the competitively sensitive information from those transactions in this record would therefore not significantly add to the Commission\'92s understanding of the issues, especially since the participants in the current proceeding and the Commission already have available the Commission\'92s prior conclusions and reasoning, as well as the underlying public\expnd-1\expndtw-5  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 information.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls20\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li299\fi721\ri187\sl240\slmult1\sb120\tx1739\tx1741\f0\fs22\b0 Second, INCOMPAS asks for information only from the few industry participants who happen to have had large transactions before the Commission.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 And in most Commission proceedings, the parties who own the confidential information are required to provide that material directly to persons who seek to review it pursuant to terms outlined in the applicable protective order.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 We find both inapposite. As an initial matter, we note that the Commission is not bound by its staff\'92s prior decisions.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1165" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1118}}
\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Additionally, in evaluating transactions between wireless telecommunications companies, the Commission regularly uses subscriber data derived from regular periodic confidential filings made by all telecommunications companies to determine market shares. In such transactions, this use of subscriber data is often the only way to calculate market share, which is a critical element to analyzing the potential competitive harms of the proposed transaction. Balancing that need against the potential competitive harm to providers, we have determined that allowing that material to be reviewed pursuant to a protective order best serves the public interest.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 Further, there was no Commission decision in the rulemaking proceeding on which the participants in the tariff proceeding could rely; the proceeding was still ongoing. All of the participants in the tariff proceeding, moreover, were participating in the rulemaking proceeding. Here, by contrast, the current rulemaking is not related to the prior transactions; the parties may rely on prior written Commission decisions; and literally millions more comments have been submitted in this rulemaking than in the prior transaction proceedings.

Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a definition for small businesses specifically applicable to Other Toll Carriers. This category includes toll carriers that do not fall within the categories of interexchange carriers, operator service providers, prepaid calling card providers, satellite service carriers, or toll resellers. The closest applicable NAICS Code category is for Wired Telecommunications Carriers as defined above. Under the applicable SBA size standard, such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1260" }}{\fldrslt 1211}}
 Census data for 2012 shows that there were 3,117 firms that operated that year. Of this total, 3,083 operated with fewer than 1,000 employees.{\field {\fldinst { HYPERLINK \\l "bookmark1261" }}{\fldrslt \fs13\up7 1212}}
\fs13\up7 \up0  \f0\fs22\b0\i0 Thus, under this category and the associated small business size standard, the majority of Other Toll Carriers can be considered small.

\fs13\up7  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\up0 The appropriate size standard under SBA rules is that such a business is small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.

While retaining the transparency rule, with modifications, from the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Open Internet Order\f0\i0 , we eliminate the additional reporting obligations, the direct notification requirements, and the broadband label \'93safe harbor,\'94 all of which will reduce the burdens of broadband Internet access service providers.

We eliminate these rules for three reasons. First, the transparency rule we adopt, in combination with the state of broadband Internet access service competition and the antitrust and consumer protection laws, obviate the need for conduct rules by achieving comparable benefits at lower cost. Second, the record does not identify any legal authority to adopt conduct rules for all ISPs, and we decline to distort the market with a patchwork of non-uniform, limited-purpose rules. Third, scrutinizing closely each prior conduct rule, we find that the costs of each rule outweigh its\expnd-2\expndtw-10  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 benefits.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls30\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li300\fi720\ri292\sl240\slmult1\sb119\tx1740\tx1741\f0\fs22\b0 We also eliminate the position of Open Internet Ombudsperson, the formal complaint process, and the issuance of advisory opinions, because the work of the Open Internet Ombudsperson is more appropriately handled by Commission staff, and because the issuance of advisory opinions and the formal complaint process have not been shown to provide any benefit to broadband Internet access service providers or\expnd-1\expndtw-4  \f0\fs22\b0\i0\expnd0\expndtw0 consumers.\par\pard\plain\s4\ls30\ilvl1\nooverflow\nocwrap\li300\fi720\ri319\sl240\slmult1\sb120\tx1740\tx1741\f0\fs22\b0 Finally, we return mobile broadband Internet access service to its original classification as a private mobile radio service and restore the definition of interconnected service that existed prior to the \f2\fs22\b0\i1 Title II Order\f0\i0 .
